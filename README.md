DOCUMENTATION FILE:
- This Program will help you find a book to read, void of inappropriate expectations and the unreliable opinions of the population. We insure that your expectations will be at the bottom of the barrel, thus promoting greater satisfaction for an excellent read, or savior from a hernia after reading a highly praised disgrace to literature, words, paper, and the trees that died so that trash may circulate under the disguise of a good book. You will be prompted to select a genre, and you may also choose to receive 5 books or only one book from your search. Once you have made your selections, the program will scrap together your book(s), and you will be given the review(s) alone, of which will all be one-star. You may choose a review upon which you will be shown the chosen book, or in the case you did not want options, your book will be shown immediately. If you are satisfied with your book, then I wish you good luck. Otherwise, you may select to revisit the remaining options, or restart the program entirely. In the extreme case you find the book to be even worse than described in the review, I bear no responsibility for any pain and suffering. I am priming you with a negative headspace, but I am also offering a unique lens in which to read, a lens that I believe substantially increases reading enjoyment. Off you go!
