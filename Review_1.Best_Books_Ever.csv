"What was I thinking? I don't like books about teens. Well, that's not entirely true...I am not a Serial Killer is about a teen boy who's sure he's the evilest thing ever born, is told from his PoV, and yet that gets darn close to 4 stars. I don't like books about teen girls. Well, that's not entirely true, either...Deathless is told from the PoV of a teen girl in a magical struggle for her life, and yet it got four full and eager stars.

So why didn't I like this book?

Because the whole thing is a cynical exercise in marketing a product that has elements the publisher recognized as hot and trending: Strong teen girl; dystopian setting; children in battle for their lives. Sound familiar? Think Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and forward. Same situation. Female hero. Technology not magic. No humor, ungraceful writing, and cold business calculation set it apart from the Potter books.

I don't know Ms. Collins, and I impute no impure motives to her. She might very well have written the story dearest to her heart, for all I know. But I do know, and have for quite some years, publishers. This is a product promoted to fill a gap in the line-up, like the Chrysler 200.

Awful. That it succeeded so well is depressing. That it's so unquestioningly lauded is either life-sappingly grim or suicide-inducingly terrible. In a country where free speech is ever under attack (hence the First Amendment, and laws supporting it...no one legislates the safety of a thing unquestioned), we waste our collective breath lauding a second-rate industrial product, a foolish simplistic ramshackle pastiche of better books that, in a better world, would merit only silence and oblivion.

Shame. Shame. And more shame on me for adding to the chorus.

If in a minor key.","This book is quite possibly the most insipid novel I have ever read in my life. Why this book is so highly treasured by society is beyond me. It is 345 pages of nothing. The characters are like wispy shadows of something that could be interesting, the language that could be beautiful ends up becoming difficult to decipher and lead me more than once to skip over entire paragraphs because I became tired of having to stumble through them only to emerge unsatisfied, and the plot is non-existent, as though Austen one day decided she wanted to write a novel and began without having any idea what would happen except that there would be a boy and a girl who seemingly didn’t like each other but in the end got married. The story really probably could have been told in about 8 pages, but Austen makes us slog through 345 pages of mind-numbing balls and dinner-parties. I don’t care what anyone says, this is not great literature. This is a snore.","While the plot was very gripping and well-written, the book didn't actually instruct me on how to kill a mockingbird. I bought this book intending to do away with this obnoxious bird that's always sitting in my backyard and making distracting noises. I had hoped this book would shed some light on how to humanely dispose of the bird, but unfortunately it was this story about a lawyer and a falsely-accused criminal. As I said, the plot is great but nowhere in the book does it say exactly how to kill a mockingbird.","I am apparently one of the few people who just do not see what all of the hype is about on this one. I was really excited to read this after all of the glowing reviews it got, but I was left extremely disappointed. I found the writing stilted and stuttering (hard to stutter in writing, but this book pulls it off), overly sentimental, and heavy-handed on the symbolism.

I also found the author's approach to the story to be just plain gimmicky. The first and foremost gimmick (also see heavyy-handed symbolism) is that the story is narrated by Death. Now, this might work in some books, but not this one. The choice of narrator adds absolutely nothing to the story; it is only a distraction to the reader, and it also encouraged the author to add trite observations about Death's perspective (for example, he doesn't carry a scythe, but likes the human image) that add nothing to the story. If Death here had been given developed personality or a unique perspective, then maybe (and even then it's a stretch) the choice of narrator would have worked. As it is, the story is told almost entirely as though by an omniscient narrator (is Death omniscient?) and we get absolutely nothing from the choice of Death to fill the role. It's a gimmick, and it falls flat.

The other gimmick I found most distracting (these are not the only two, but they are the most egregious) is the repeated use of little newsflash-type, bold and centered notes that appear periodically through the story to highlight some stupid point and add (in the author's mind) dramatic effect. These newsflashes, as I think of them, were irritating and served only to break up the natural narrative flow without adding anything significant. This is another example of the author hitting the reader over the head with his points, rather than trusting his own writing to get the message across. This is another ill-conceived and heavy-handed gimmick intended to correct for a poor narrative.

I think it is telling that while this book gets listed as teen fiction, Zusak actually wrote it for adults. For some reason, it got identified as being for teens when it got marketed in the U.S. (it was written in Australia). It seems to me that the explanation for this change is that the novel feels like it was written by a very immature author, and so the prose does not attain the quality one should expect of adult fiction.

I think good Holocaust stories need to be told, but the Book Thief fails at that endeavor. The story is trite; the narrative is sentimental and uninspired. I recommend that you look elsewhere for something better. If you want something for younger readers, try Number the Stars, by Lois Lowry. If you're a bit older, also read Night by Elie Weisel or the Diary of Anne Frank. I might even add in Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, to counteract the heavy-handed book-burning theme of the Book Thief. There's plenty more out there that better deserve your time and attention than does this book.",,,"This is the John Green-i-est book of all John Green books, and I hate it and him more than anything.

My sister and I actually have a running joke where we just quote this book back and forth to each other. Although honestly anytime anyone says ""It's a metaphor,"" I immediately say ""ya put tha killin' thing between ya teeth but ya don't give it the power to do its killin'!"", affecting the mannerisms of a stereotypical paperboy from the 1920s.

It gets a laugh every time. (Or at least a sound of disgust, which is just as satisfying within this context.)

There are just so many laughable quotes. ""I fell in love the way you fall asleep: Slowly, then all at once."" ""Some infinities are bigger than other infinities."" ""It would be a privilege to have my heart broken by you."" ""Because you are beautiful. I enjoy looking at beautiful people, and I decided a while ago not to deny myself the simpler pleasures of existence."" (That one is a good one if you, like me, love your friends a lot but are bad at compliments. This will ensure that they know you love them, but also prevent them from ever wanting to talk to you ever again.)

Oh, and: ""My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations."" (That last one is probably my favorite, because it gets the most horrified reaction from the audience.) And how could I almost forget the classics: ""Maybe 'okay' could be our 'always.'"" (Also, of course I had to look up those quotes. While I love John Green jokes, my brain is so inherently opposed to him that I cannot memorize his sh*t for the life of me. I still mess up the killing thing between your teeth quote, and I say that one at least weekly.)

Anyway. It's comedy gold because this crap is cringe-worth-i-ly affected and pretentious and unrealistic, but also focuses on basic key words and concepts you can latch onto and bring up in pretty much any given conversation.

What? Yes, all of my friends do hate me. Why do you ask?

I am just about full to bursting and sick to death of John Green's quasi-profound books and boring guys and manic girls and token diverse background characters with one quirk and not much else. I don't know how much more pretentious dialogue and profound ponderings and fake teenage angst I can take.

Perhaps unsurprisingly,t his is not so much of a mini review, but I feel like I've had a buildup of John Green-directed anger of late. Don't get me wrong, I'm constantly boiling in it, just due to who I am as a person, but his return to writing and that ugly cover reveal are making me even madder. WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE, JOHN. IS THIS BECAUSE YOU KNOW I WILL HAVE TO READ YOUR NEW BOOK, SINCE I HAVE LONG JUSTIFIED MY HATRED FOR YOU BY SAYING I'VE READ ALL YOUR SH*T AND DISLIKED IT ALL?

Can you tell that I somewhat irrationally believe he knows that I hate him? I've been so outspoken about it. Granted, over half of that outright opposition took place in my junior year AP World History class, but still. The man could have eyes everywhere.

Why, you may ask, do I continue to scream about him if I'm so scared he and his cringey YouTube videos and rabid fans will come for my life?

Because he is horrible. I enjoy ranting about horrible people, and I decided a while ago not to deny myself the simpler pleasures of existence.

(This is part of a project I am doing wherein I write mini reviews of books I read a long time ago. Yes, I am aware that this doesn't exactly fit anyone's definition of a mini review.)","One star because I loathed Dorian Gray and Henry what's-his-name. Morally-shady/immoral characters have never appealed to me, and whenever I encounter them they end up ruining the entire experience (a notable exception was Wuthering Heights).

Sibyl Vane's narrative was boring and I do agree that she was shallow and quite idiotic...There was an entire chapter dedicated to describing Dorian's experimentation with jewelry and embroidery which was so completely mind-numbing I skipped it altogether. And by the last quarter or so I'd stopped reading and just skimmed the rest. I bet I would've enjoyed this more if I'd simply read the ""notes on text"" and saved myself a whole lot of ennui (a word Henry likes to use and which, unbeknownst to him, applies splendidly to almost everything he says).

In addition, I do not understand the author's insistence that The Picture of Dorian Gray, or any work of art for that matter, ought to be assessed based on its artistic/aesthetic value and not on whether it carries a moral message, because I love it when the book I'm reading is trying to convey something...I actually feel that this book contains a moralistic idea: that one should never fully indulge one's whims and passions without considering their consequences, and that physical beauty means very little when you are an abhorrent human being on the inside.

I would also condemn a work of art if I found it preaches, encourages, praises, or otherwise tries to present in a positive light, an action or an idea that I consider to be immoral. Obviously homosexuality does not belong in this category if that is what Wilde was trying to get around.","I received my copy of Gone With the Wind in 1991 and never got past the first 50 or 100 pages in any of my annual attempts at this books until 2004, at which point I decided to defeat the book one and for all. I FINALLY FINISHED READING THE DAMN BOOK.

I want my time back.

There was a reason I never before read past the first 50 or 100 pages - Scarlet is a raging evil snarky miserable bitch and I hate her. None of the other characters were particularly likable - ranging from sniveling, whiny sissies to evil, snarky assholes.

I don't care if it *is* some great story about surviving in a war zone or some bullshit line like that. None of these characters really expressed the complexities or debated the moral dilemmas involved in surviving the Civil War. Scarlet was a whiny, conniving miserable human being and I don't give a crap if she ""only did what she had to do as a woman."" She didn't have to treat Ashley or Rhett or ANYONE the way she did, or she could have at least felt bad about it or something.

I disliked every single character and their miserable lives. I want my time back.

But by God did it feel good when Rhett tells her ""My dear, I don't give a damn"" because neither do I.

(PS: I am, in fact, allowed to dislike this book. You don't need to reply to my review by calling me names. I'm perfectly happy to hear about why you did like it, or why you didn't like it, but I'm tired of people coming to MY review and calling me names because I don't like this ""classic"" book."")

(PPS: This book is also a racist & sexist glorification of a racist & sexist past. It's the literary equivalent of the Confederate Flag.)

Seriously, folks. You can just read this and disagree and then not say a single thing. A for fuck's sake, don't come here and be an asshole to me if you don't like my review. Get the fuck off my lawn.

And don't come here saying I want to ban or burn the book, like Nazis. I don't. You can read whatever you want. I don't believe in banning or burning books. I do believe this book is the Confederate flag of literature.",,"I did not like this book.

I am about to try to explain why that is so, here, in my own, personal review space. I am critiqing this book, based on my own opinions, personal taste, experiences and perspective, criteria and standards for literary work. It is entirely subjective, as I think all reviews, per definition, are.

I mean no disrespect to the people who like this book, and who have found in it something of value. You are as entitled to your own opinion, subjective readingexperience, and standards, as I am, and yours is just as valid. And you have the same opportunity as me, to use your own review space, to clarify that. We don’t all have to agree. One opinion isn’t ‘wrong’ and the other ‘right’ – they are both right, personally speaking, because it is subjective.
If you are a big fan of this book, and have difficulty in understanding or respecting people, who disagree with you, especially on issues that are important to you, I advice you not to read any further. I will not be saying nice things about this book.

I want to underline that I look at Charlie as a written character, not a real person, and I critique the book as a literary piece of work, not as a real life story. To me, there is a huge difference between the two.
------------------------------

Some of the things that matter most to me in books are prose/writing style, storytelling and message. It’s one of the things that can make or break a book for me.
In this case, the writing style just didn't work for me.
It was just too lacking .
Maybe it's the whole premise of the book, a story narrated by someone who is emotionally inhibited as Charlie, that didn't work for me? Maybe, but it didn't have to be. That issue and Charlie’s character could have been explored and dealt with, literary, in other ways.
The book could have had Charlie’s narration interact with someone else’s (like an answer to the letters for example), or it could have been written in the 3rd person, maintaining Charlie’s point of view, but also being able to draw in other views, and how they collide with Charlie’s.

I find it a bit concerning, that Chbosky wrote a book with so many serious issues like suicide, death, rape, social exclusion/inclusion, relationship violence, abortion, drugs, homosexual adventures, childmolestation/incest, parties, fights, without really dealing with any one of them in depth. To have all of these issues crammed into one book, without giving it the time and place it deserves, I felt, was a huge fault. Each one of these issues needs to be taken seriously, not pointed out on one page, just to be forgotten on the next. If you are going to write about these things, write about it well, give it the space and the in-depth exploration it deserves. To make the reader care for these characters, for these issues, the author and the characters involved must care too. I had a hard time stomaching that both Chbosky and the characters seemed to care so little, for something that is so very very real and so very very difficult, for so many people. It was almost making a mockery of them, which was very off-putting to me.
The staccato writing and Charlie’s detached narrating, made me feel detached as well.
The story is written in a very plain, very dull, very simple language, with the same sentences reoccurring over and over (eg. ""..I don't know why.."" , ""He/she looked sad."")
The emotional description amounts to 'sad' or 'happy'.

The portrayals of Charlie and everyone else in the story was so lacking that they felt like cardboard cutouts and simply came off as what they were; made up characters in a fictional story (and not a very good one at that if you ask me).

The main character, Charlie, is 15, but comes off as much younger than that. Again, I would have wished for some more in-depth exploration of why and what is the basis of this, to better be able to understand and relate to Charlie’s character.

Charlie also cries a lot, which wouldn’t be a problem, if it was more nuancedly described. I don’t want to see /read about just the surface tears. I want to be taken behind the tears, into the pool they stem from, the pain they are a symptom of and maybe a release from? I want the author to show me what these tears mean, I want to understand them, to be touched by them, to be moved with the ebb and flow of them. In this case, that didn’t happen.
The sentence ""I/he/she started to cry"" alone, just doesn’t stir much emotion in me. Especially not when thrown about on every other page. Then it just gets bothersome and tiring.
It's not that I have an aversion to tears (my own or others'). Crying is normal, and can be very healthy and soothing.
But when it comes to a literary work, I expect the author to give more nuanced descriptions of feelings than just bucketful of tears. Okay, so they are sad. Very, very sad. Very often. Now, show me what that sadness does to someone, besides producing tears, tears, tears. I am not interested in the tears alone. The sadness is the root, the tears are a symptom. Many people are filled with sadness, but don’t produce many tears. Sadness can overflow in many ways. So: the sadness is the key.
Which is why I was so disappointed that Chbosky never digged deeper than this very very thin surface. All I got was tears. And I wonder if all the crying came down to Chbosky simply not knowing how else to describe emotions, or how explore them.

Much thought and debate has been given to the question why Charlie is, the way he is.
There is the fact that he suffered from childhood trauma, and then there is the question of whether or not Charlie might be autistic. The latter is hinted at and up for interpretation, but never explicitly stated/diagnosed.
The autistic spectrum is a varied one, and it comes in many forms, very few fitting the standard, but classic ‘rainman’ syndrome of a very intelligent but socially closed off person. It’s admirable to want to write about autism, a difficult diagnosis to live with, sure. I just don’t think Chbosky is doing autistic people any favors or justice with his depiction of Charlie as someone who might or might not be autistic.
Again I must say: if you are going to write about it, write about it with care. Don’t make it into a guessing game, but own it. Don’t glamorize or deride it, but show its many layers and nuances through the particulars and the concrete.
The same goes for the psychological trauma. It wasn’t given the care and attention it deserved. It was left at the end as an easy way out, like 'hey, he suffered/suffers from this and so i'm excused for writing a terribly boring book'.
No.
Whatever made Charlie the way he is, it doesn’t compensate for how the story was written and pulled off.
To me, it's really besides the point, since I don’t base my rating/review on pity for a character.

SO whether Charlie has any form of autism or not, doesn't really matter, because I thought he and the story was very poorly written.
and let me be clear about this:
It's not the disorder I have a problem with, it's the writing of it.

Note (November, 2013): I recently saw the movie, and thought it was better than the book.
Maybe because it fixed some of the issues I had with the book, like it left some of the drama llama out and it wasn't as heavily centered on Charlie's narration and perspective, and emotions and reactions was expressed through expressions instead of just (bad) writing. Different type of media - different possibilities. For this story, i think movie worked better than writing.","Reader, gaze upon my tortured physiognomy and answer me one question that I shall pose to thee in the languid torpor of the drooping, sinister twilight of my soul, one which surely reveals more of my own humble, Quakerish origins, unappealing countenance and begs you as my interlocutrice to satisfy my curiosity: why?

I can understand intellectually why this book would have been important when it was written and how its pivotal place in the history of the novel has shaped modern literature &c. but holy GOD it is like reading 507 pages of needlepoint. In which precious little happens except that you start to realize that editing must be a fairly young profession and that perhaps if you really hated your English students you could pick out one of the sentences that is roughly the same length as the Gettysburg Address and make them diagram it? For reals, you'd get these honking paragraphs that would start, ""There was..."" and then if you were diagramming you'd have a frightfully kudzu-covered six-story scaffold of indirect objects and modifiers trailing behind it.

What is it about Jane Eyre that seems to be an educated female rite of passage? I was somewhat looking forward to this book as it's an example of a strong woman who knows herself, but no. She's basically being ping-ponged between a couple of over-verbose dweebs who both have frightfully controlling tendencies and her only hope of independence is getting a windfall through the mother of all deus ex machina.

Ladies: Jane is holding you back.

Protip: if a guy twice your age who freely admits his proclivity for continental floozies, gruffly dismisses his own possible child except to underpay staff to deal with her, is intense and flies into passions, makes you mop up after and keep silent about assaults in your home and then fails to mention until you're at the altar that oh, he's married and the psycho who tried to kill you in your bed is actually his WIFE, you get gone and stay gone.

Seriously, if I wanted to read about a teenager who spent half her time complaining about her looks and then dithering around about whether to go with the dark brooding intense hottie or the fair,marble-faced Greek god, I would go read Twilight.","What a feeble attempt at recreating the Harry Potter magic! Aside from being highly unoriginal and unimaginative, the book grates on your nerves due to the frequency of Percy's lame attempts at sounding witty. Seriously, I'm supposed to laugh at his observations on the 'Bull Man' and 'barnyard animals'?
Not only did the writer not bother racking his brains to come up with a plot or a proper story, choosing instead to recycle key elements of the Harry Potter series, but he also ignored important aspects of a fantasy novel, one of which is the language. To call the narration just bad will be an understatement. Same can be said about the dialogue and the way the plot progresses - it's one cliched event unfolding after another.
The only novel thing about this book is the seamless integration of Greek mythology into a fantasy-based set-up. The 1 star is for that.
And so I'd like to put a premature end to my review because I just realized the futility of writing one of a book I hated.",,"Instead of reading this book, drink vodka in a dark room and think depressing thoughts. That will give you about the same experience and you'll have a better time.","Instead of bashing this book, I'm simply going to quote a post I saw because it put my thoughts into words:

""Japanese woman tells white American man about her past life as a geisha. White man then writes a novel that sells itself as an accurate memoir of Japanese woman's life, but instead falsifies a number of her life events, misrepresents her trade, and exoticises her culture. He also names her as a source even though she specifically asked him to keep her anonymous. Japanese woman gets death threats. White American man becomes bestselling author.

Then Japanese woman gets fed up and writes her own memoir to set the record straight. Meanwhile, white American man's book gets adapted into a film that grosses $162 million and wins three Oscars.""","Ladies and gentlemen, a chapter of my life has come to a close today. A new leaf has turned. Les Mis is over. Never again will that brick haunt my coffee table or nightstand. I am. A. Free. Woman. Eleven years...ELEVEN...I've stolidly worn the chains of oppression from that Hugo guy.

Never again.

What was happening eleven years ago? I was in my freshman year of college; a friend and I made a pact that we would start reading through classics together. And had the massive misfortune of choosing Les Mis as our first purgatory. Er, project.

As this was one of my first massive tome classics, I think I had to prove to myself I could finish it. Because I'm vain and don't want anyone to think I just cOuLDn'T ApPReCiAtE it....I've slammed down Anna Karenina, The Silmarillion, and Moby Dick with gusto and enjoyed them all. In the end, this is just a matter of taste.

Victor Hugo strikes me as pompous. And I recognize that's entirely subjective. But holy moly the man likes to hear himself soliloquize to the nth degree. There's a sentence that's 823 words long with 93 commas and 51 semicolons. Read. That. Again.

The level of historic detail is astounding...or details in general. At one point, we slog through about fifty pages of detail just describing the sewer system. All because one of the characters walks over a sewer grate. The excessive info dumping is frequent and frivolous.

Hugo also enjoys expounding on philosophy, love, and death- among other things- for pages on end. Via run-on sentences.

I've come to the realization that I just may not be cut out for French novels. Typically, they involve one romantic interest pining to death over another one after simply looking at them for the first time (e.g. through the windows) and dramatically seeking death at the first instance of inconvenience to a potential relationship. Also, watching her through windows? Creepy, bud. Creepy.

I'd rate this book a PG-13 for some mild language, adult themes, and violence.",,,"I was never expecting anything from this but an entertaining and maybe a little bit forgettable book. I was wrong; I found this completely unforgettable. For being a trainwreck.

To be quite honest, I think 75% of the hype for this series comes from nostalgia. Listen, I'm sorry, I know this isn't everything, but I really... don't get why these first three books are hyped, on any level. Not only do I have ten million problems with the tropey nature and the slutshaming and the etc etc etc, it's also just... boring and also, I hate every single character. I hated... almost everything about this, until book three, which I thought was okay because it didn't take me four months [you think I'm kidding?] and also for ending the incest plotline. [Yeah, that.]

Listen, I am not opposed to fun trash. I read The Infernal Devices this year and it was fantastic, and books two and three basically emotionally killed me inside. But this was not fun for me.

Okay, so first of all, because we've all talked about this, The Mortal Instruments is kind of based off Cassandra Clare’s Harry Potter fanfiction [no, I'm not kidding], and it is painfully obvious. There are basic things, like that humans are known as “mundanes,” while in Harry Potter they are known as “muggles.” But then there's also the fact that the characters kind of feel like not good fanfiction interpretations of various Harry Potter characters. Our redheaded lead character, Clary Fray, is a slightly stupider version of Ginny Weasley. Her love interest, Jace Wayland, is essentially Draco Malfoy if everyone excused his actions because he’s super hot. [I really don't like Jace.] Jace becomes a member of the Ripoff Death Eaters in like book two because his father is Ripoff Voldemort [his name is Valentine. which is actually hilarious]. Simon is... Harry [again, not a very good one], and Isabelle is Hermione, if Hermione were there exclusively to be slut-shamed by the angelic virgin protagonist.

I mostly said this to point out how utterly fucking dull these characters are, but... listen, I'm not actually wrong about this. If you match the characters up to her fanfiction [which is not hard], the pairings fit. You know that thing I linked up above? Well, it discusses how the fanfiction trilogy [I mean, kudos for that dedication] is endgame Draco/Ginny and Harry/Hermione, with subtext between Harry/Draco [I'm so sorry, I'm laughing typing this]. The endgame of this series is Jace/Clary and Simon/Isabelle, with subtext between Jace/Simon. Do. you. think. I'm. kidding.

But listen, you'd think that after ripping from fucking Harry Potter, Clare would’ve at least come up with something interesting? I mean, fiction doesn't have to be original to be good. But again, it's basically boring, boring, boring, offensive, boring, jace is hot chapter, boring.

I... don't even know where I'm going with this, I just need you all to know that this originated as Harry Potter fanfiction. Although I will point out that the original fanfiction this was based off of got taken off fanfiction.net after plagiarism accusations. And then there were Sherrilyn Kenyon's plagiarism accusations. I mean, I think fanfiction and original fiction used to be considered very different things in a way they almost aren't today, but... it's important to know.

Anyway. I've established at this point that the characters are flat, it's all painfully derivative, and the books themselves are... boring. But... there is so much more.

Beyond the issue of Clary's I'm-not-like-other-girls thing, there's also the issue of messily handled lgbtq stuff. So, yes, it's 2005, and I'm willing to excuse this... a little bit Alec Lightwood's entire presence in this book is to Create Some Angst through homophobia and it feels... so much like a plot device, not going to lie. While it's fair to mention that Cassandra Clare has improved her lgbtq rep - severalsapphic friends of mine would like to notify you that The Dark Artifices is awesome wrt this - it's not good in this series. Alec is barely a POV character in the first three books of the series, despite being marketed as a major character, and feels super tokenistic. Also, just... his treatment. At one point in this series, his mother, who is a supposedly likeable character, tries to kill him and his boyfriend for being gay, which he forgives her for [how?]. There is later on a lot of explicit biphobia towards Magnus [who is my favorite. I love Magnus] that is not subverted or criticized at all, and in this book especially, there's an intonation of that slutty bi trope [though the character is allowed to develop beyond that, man, it is there.]
“You're not gay, are you?""
Simon's greenish color deepened. ""If I were, I would dress better.”

this... is... not... funny...

No, Cassandra Clare would rather focus on something else: a sideplot where Ripoff Ginny Weasley believes Hot Draco Malfoy is her brother for two fucking books. It is exactly as terrible as it sounds. For two full books, I had to live through Ripoff Ginny Weasley’s angst over her crush on her brother and about their forbidden love or whatever the shit. Yes, I KNOW they eventually realize they weren't related. But here's the thing; they're still in love when they believe they are. They almost have sex while still believing they're related [book three]. That's not even the weirdest part; they do it in Voldemort Except Boring’s home, right after they almost physically die, and it's wild. Do you know how many hours I spent trying to wash my eyes out after reading this? Why, exactly, is sex between two people who literally think they are siblings an enjoyable thing to read about? The focus on Draco Malfoy’s bare chest was bad enough; I don’t need to think about incest sex too.

Oh, and there are so many constant descriptions of Jace’s utter maleness. It honestly feels like an entire book jacking off to the thought of Draco Malfoy’s bare chest. It's not good.

I don't know. I guess not everything is bad? The worldbuilding was possibly something cool ten years ago, but it's pretty typical nowadays. I'll also give Clare a bit of credit - she's pretty great at writing dialogue. The moments where the characters are chatting or hanging out in squad dynamics are a lot of fun.

But overall... no. It's full of tropes, there aren't really any plot twists, and it's honestly just boring. I'm sorry, I really don't understand the hype. Like, come on, besides being an example of all the worst bits of YA literature, from the underdeveloped characters to the lackluster worldbuilding, this first book truly takes the cake as one of the worst I've ever read.

Oh, and I'm just going to say it: Jace and Simon have huge crushes on each other. I am NOT giving up this opinion. I don't really give a shit about either of them or care about this relationship, I'm just saying that factually, they talk about each other like they want to have wild sex. I'm ALSO saying that the ending scene of book two reads like shitty vampire smut. I'm picturing it on fanfiction.net with the description m/m blood drinking kink erotica don't like don't read!!!

VERDICT: This book is terrible. I'm somewhat shocked to say that it gets a little better later on, but this one is objectively terrible. Maybe just skip to book two if you genuinely want to read the series [listen, I like The Infernal Devices]. Or skim. Please just skim.","I was uncomfortable with the tone of the book; I felt that the author played to very stereotypical themes, and gave the characters (especially the African American ones) very inappropriate and obvious voices and structure in terms constructing their mental character. I understand that the author wrote much of this as a result of her experiences growing up in the south in the 1960's, and that it may seem authentic to her, and that she was even trying to be respectful of the people and the time; but, ultimately, I thought that it was written from a very narrow, idealized, almost childish perspective of race relations without a true appreciation of the humanity and soul of the characters. And the ultimate theme & message (i.e. ""why, we're all the same - there's no difference between us after all!"") only reinforced my feeling that this is written from someone who has a very undeveloped or underdeveloped concept of race and race relations in the United States. The author would benefit from exploring authentic African American voices (Richard Wright, James Baldwin, Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes, Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, Maya Angelou) and understanding the scope, range and (most important) the foundation of the emotions genuine African American characters express as a result of their journey as a people in the US (hope, frustration, drive, passion, anger, happiness, sadness, depression, joy).","I was rather disappointed by this classic. It started out with promise, especially the Jonathan Harker bits. Then all the male characters descended into blubbering worshippers of the two female characters, and by the end of the novel, I was wishing Dracula could snack on all of them and be done with it. I kept having to put it aside and read chapters in between other books, but I managed to finish it at last.","I wanted to like Ender's Game. I really did. It's a wonder that even after more than halfway into the book, I still clung on to the foolishly optimistic notion that the book would somehow redeem itself. That it would end up justifying the tedious, repetitive, drearily dull chapters I trundled through over the course of several days (which is unusual, since I'm generally a fast reader).

It pains me to say it, as a hardcore fangirl of science fiction, that one of sci-fi's most beloved and highly regarded novels did not do it for me. Actually, that is understating it. While I'm at it, I'll just duck and blurt it out: I loathed Ender's Game.

Deep breaths. Let that sink in. Let the hate flow through you. Good, strike me down...I am unarmed.

Okay. Now let's get to it.

Was it because the expectations I had in my mind were unreasonably high and thus were responsible for ruining the book for me? No way. I make no bones about the fact that Ender's Game, regardless of the respect and popularity it commands in sci-fi circles, is an inherently bad novel.

Why, though, you might ask. Why such vitriol for the book? Here you are, then.

1) Bad plotting: It didn't take me long to realise that after I was past Ender's arrival at the Battle School, every - literally every chapter thereon until his return to Earth - was more or less the same thing. Battle games, beating the shit out of kids, battle games, switching back and forth to Armies, battle games. It was so repetitive that I was exhausted at the end of every.single.chapter. Page after page after page of six year old, seven year old, eight year old Ender and his buddies zooming about in ships trying to freeze one another's socks off. Wheeee!

2) Lack of characterisation: There are no personalities. There are no motivations. You never learn anything about the characters except that they are the good guys or the bad guys. Ender is brilliant at everything. He NEVER loses. Not once. Bernard, Stilson and Co. are the bad guys. They're evil baddies cause dey r jealuz of ender's brilliance omg!!! That's it. No background, no depth, no internal conflicts. No motivation. Words cannot express how two-dimensional and woefully lacking in personality the characters are.

3) Demosthenes and Locke. What the heck was that all about? I appreciate Card's prescience about the 'Nets' and blogging before it was around, but come on, this is pushing it a bit too far. How, I beg you, how are we supposed to take the idea that a pair of kids end up taking the world by posting in online forums and blogging?

As if we people of the internet didn't have enough delusions of grandeur already. ;)

4) Now, this really gets my goat:I had to wait for the last 20 pages to get information that was of any worth to the story at all. I'm talking about Mazer's Rackham explaning the buggger's communications system to Ender. As for the 'twist ending': I honestly, and I mean, honestly did not find that riveting. It was predictable and, worse, did not justify all that I had to read to make my way to the end.

5)Also: It was hard to feel for Ender. I say this as a high-school nerd in my own day, as the reviled and hated and made-fun-of socially awkward kid who wanted to be good at whatever they did. But that doesn't make me any more sympathetic to Ender. Honestly, I fail to see what's so great about Ender anyway. I am so infuriated at Card for this. Apart from Ender's claim to intelligence (which is never completely explained, by the way) there is nothing, NOTHING, that is worth justifying him as the protagonist of one of scifi's supposedly best books ever. Yes, he loves his sister Valentine. Yes, he doesn't want to hurt people. Yes, he goes ahead and does it anyway. Again and again. (Ending up murdering two school boys in the process. Uhm, major wtf there.)

I am rarely so caustic about the books I read, but this time I feel I am justified in doing so. I had such hopes for this book. Not impossibly high or anything. At the very least, I had expected to like it, you know? I remember, as I worked my way past chapters 4,5,7,10,14...I expected it to get better. I expected myself to be mistaken at the initial dissatisfaction, then incredulity, then mild annoyance and then a string of sad sighs and resignation to dislike. Alas, I wasn't mistaken. I felt betrayed. I thought this book was right up there with those 'kindred ones', you know? The sort of books you can come back to again and again. Instead, what I got was a bad plotline, progressively unrealistic plot developments, and a cast of flat, lifeless, unpleasant characters to boot. Ender's Game, how I wish I had loved you. Why did you forsake me thus.",
"A lot of things are troubling me about The Hunger Games. A lot of things which I more and more perceive and which are not solely connected with this book but with the metaphor behind the words. People attach themselves to fictional freedom without seeing what really something is and which unfortunately is here to stay because you can't wake a person who is pretending to be asleep. You can’t make a shift on a deeper level, if the only thing that attracts you to this book is – a vision of fight, retaliation and the outcome of freedom. Freedom of flesh.

In comparison to the freedom of and from your mind which is nowhere to be found.

And this is why I detest this book, although detest is such a strong from the ego word. Because the whole purpose of this story is to show how people shouldn’t sacrifice their children for the better of their communities and with the positive outcomes realise that we are so much stronger and yada yada.

THE WHOLE PURPOSE of this book should be that there shouldn’t even be in the first place a need to sacrifice members of our society for some other people to be amused. And where after the battle of ''united'' people we heal and repair the damages for the better tomorrow. The society cancer of western civilisation thinking.

Heal the damage, never heal the cause of it.

But then we wouldn’t be talking here about the same book. We would be discussing how humanity can help each other with being better, with taking responsibility and with being open to each other.

And yet imagine this paradox we live in: better, as if the majority of population can even understand that we are in constant blood thirst to achieve peace. With war comes peace. While along the way we are trying to be better and safer. Yet most people deliberately choose to live on the utmost lowest level of their existence. In fear, frightened of itself.

And people read books which are so extreme in their bullshit. And people connect with Katniss because she is the heroine. She has managed to outsmart the system. Instead of thinking that she was not even supposed be there in the first place. Because we live in society that does this to their children.

''No, we don’t!''

''We do...''

''But children can learn how to fight.''

''You teach them to fight for individual puppeteers. And instead of working on yourself, how to achieve your inner peace, you associate yourself again with the group because it feels better to be in the tortured crowd, instead of being alone and awakened.''

''What are you talking about? It is just emo gibberish. Leave Katniss alone. And in the end, it is just a book. Why don’t you want people to read and educate themselves, does everything have to be deep and meaningful, can’t you just relax?''

Yes, everything has to be deep and meaningful since we are drowning in shit of meaningless and shallow. The system as it is, the plot of this book is just another evidence to show us how we are controlled. That we are left barren from our true selves which we only find in empathy, love towards each other and genuinely understanding that we are one and everything is one. But on this provincial&marginal&primitive&emotional level, so many took this book for granted.

And the only reason I am writing this review here, the only reason I am giving it so much attention is to tell what is on my mind since it is so widely popular and since I have read it. And one of the main reasons why I can’t really keep things light and popsy is because so many things are already deep down in gutter light and popsy and mainstream. As if having money is any critieria for life, as if not having your own free will and education and information means nothing. And the other side of the rich coin is poverty with people who believe in symbols, who are sidetracked with religions, censured TV, economy and utter lack of information circulation.

And a lot of people here are trying to disregard this review and want to reassure me that I am so terribly wrong. BUT, you have yet not seen what I am talking about and it is perfectly OK.

So I followed as well screaming Goodreads recommendations and I bought a book that is stupid, violent and written so plainly but of course written for vast masses so they can be touched by fake social awareness. Because it is fake, but most of all it’s tragic.

And this is not a critique toward Collins, in my nature of a thinker and seeing her a person who shared her thoughts and which millions of people loved and connected with, I am still a firm believer that the general public just didn’t understand what she was talking about. And this is my silver lining. Because it has been like this throughout centuries and with the biggest thinkers of our civilisation. What they meant and wanted to show, is definitely not what most of the public projected.

Because the mainstream public is a group of sheep, not seeing anything properly, but following and like a Tarzan, screaming, don’t you dare stealing my Jane from me. As a metaphor, don’t you dare telling me these uplifting emotions are not true, when all in me about this book tells me that is correct and how people should live their lives.

And if the mainstream likes it, uh, then definitely that is not what it’s true.

It is just a constant reminder how so many things are left unrecognised while these superficial stories which evoke cheap emotions are always so hugely praised. It could have been just a little story but never underestimate the obese octopus that is called In God And Country We Trust - code red mentality. Mentality of humans which are too ignorant, beautifully naive and untouched basically with what is means to be socially aware.

And although this is a teen book, it is more deeply hurting and sickening because if you want to influence somebody, of course you will influence the children – and yet there is nothing that children can learn from it. They can learn some things, we all need little courageous Katniss, but on a deeper subtler level is it just an intravenous injection of more Nothing and more Numbing and more Disconnected.

At least they read is one of the arguments. And argument as fruitfull as at least they eat GMO food. One food for the blind intellect, other for the digestion which both results in basic survival without any interference of you in all of it. Because it takes courage and guts and a pinch of anarchy to stop, turn around and start questioning what is handed.

For me, the thought about giving this to a child is sickening especially because we live in this world where all the life criterias are upside down. Because a child will not learn how things are vile and disturbing because Katniss told them through her delusional and hyperventilating focus, but a child will learn about life’s cruelty, and it will be touched by it sooner or later, by questioning everything that is served in front of it.

Because if it is served somebody is earning money and you are just getting fatter and sicker.

And the children will learn how to question if you teach them how to find not if you broadcast them the answers. Not if you teach them through aggressive examples and if you keep the nation in cold sweat especially if you are lucky enough to live in the countries where oppression is not the issue but consumerism, body image and mediocrity have you on the leash.

I am astonished with a fact that around 75.000 Goodreads members read this book and that around 50.000 of them rated it 5 stars. What is it that fascinates them so much.

It’s disturbing because people obviously associate and find themselves in this book. And it's about a girl Katniss Everdeen, living in the far away future, who was chosen to participate in a cruel Big Brother game, in which 24 contestants (children age 12-18) kill each other, because live TV has become demanding, and the public loves reality blood and violence. That's it. A little bit of undeveloped and unbelievable romance between her and two boys, a little bit of her abandoned family problems, a little bit of The 5th element movie political structure, mutants and pop stylists. It’s so screwed up.

In the beginning, first 50 pages were well written. There was suspense, Katniss was sweet and witty, but overall this book is a shitty meltdown. Adding the ridiculous cliffhanger ending. Some people here are using words like dystopian literature, and then write essays about how this book is the core of it.

The core is pointlessly graphic and sadistic, without any concrete message except of the negative: this book is just proving that the world today is fucked up if this book is so successful. I don’t see the point of reading about the fictional kids who are doing this to each other.

In a metaphorical way it is promoting political establishments of certain countries and that is getting tiring. Not all people are eager to swallow the shit of general brainwashing. Katniss being the heroine (ironical quote marks). Being loyal and darling and a role model. Just wake up. Life is happening and some pretty dark things are happening while you are thinking that Katniss is the representative of the club called liberation.

For me, in a bookish way it stands for one bad one night stand, kiss and forget. But as always, readers tend to bring fiction to their real life and just as many think that kittens and superheroes are comfort zones, a lot of readers perceive this plot as their own little shrine.

But that is me not being in tune with the mainstream population which is too distracted with billboards.

Because it is easier, because why protest, why not simply take what you are given - eat your GMO Monsanto's company hamburgers, eat your cancer giving Nestle products and think that The Hunger Games are the best franchise ever, like ever. If you don't have any arguments about real life activism and if you think that there is deepness in this plot which I have yet not seen so you need to enlightened me, just include North Korea or Hitler or ISIS(L) or those poor people who are closed in Zara hangers who work nonstop ''somewhere'' in the world because obviously you are aware of the crisis although you don’t think you could show on the map but you have heard somewhere on Murdoch media.

This shit sells. It's genuinely bad but excellently targeted. You know, it evokes pride and loyalty and massacring children, freedom and scandal and Hollywood. It goes very well with all the Kardashian filth. As long as it sells, sells, sells. And marketing agencies know that people are united when they are jealous, when they want and they with those hamburgers want freedom. Nobody is going to kill their Katniss in a goddam book! Really? Take a look around you.

And then the punch line for this book comes from the so called activism from the shopping mall. People who devour literature of this kind and think that everything is all right while in the same time, fuck, you are getting oozingly fat.

Bottom line.

This book is very shallow and MTV culture oriented, like a classical example of easy consummated pop-literature; I'm very surprised that it didn't come with some trash magazine subscription. If it doesn't have savage brutality, prize money and prefix ''media coverage'' then it won't be appealing and educational because surely this is how children of 21st century survive this techno media world; through examples of true moral issues and realistic outcomes. Have another gulp of Coca-Cola along the way while you listen to dubstep shit.

It saddens me when a violent hillbillish book is so popular. What is there to truly identify yourself with. Except if your chicken soup for soul are basic emotions which come with buy 1 get 1 free.","Jesus Christ, just have sex.","So far, I have found that this book is complete drivel. I don't understand the mass appeal to this novel, nor do I understand how it managed to go down in history as an amazing piece of America literature. This book has no plot, no point, and no real characters.

The characters in this book are one dimensional and painfully drab. They all seem to have the same personality with a few minor differences, and all that does is create boring dialogue and an uninteresting point of view. Harper Lee may be talented with using advanced vocabulary, but that does not make her a good writer.

There is no conflict in this book. There's no personality. There's nothing interesting that compels me to read more.

I'm fairly far into the book, and yet I still have no idea what it is about. If I could rate this book no stars, I would do so. This book is a necessary read for my honors English class, but if I could get away with not reading it I would do it without a bit of hesitation.

As soon as I am done with this sorry excuse for a book, I am either going to tend to my fireplace using the pages as kindling or stash this book in the far corners of my basement where it will live out the rest of its days in darkness. I am not afraid to say with all honesty that this is possibly one of the most terrible wastes of paper I have ever laid eyes on.","I had a hardcover of this book. I no longer have it. I did not even finish reading it, because it irritated me so much and when I asked if it got better no one could convince me that it was worth persevering.

I know that there are many people who love this book, authors who's book I love, readers who's tastes I respect. But I couldn't stand the narrator. Every time the Narrator intruded on the story it felt like exactly that--an intrusion. A lot of people really like the narrator, and I imagine if you did the book would be much more enjoyable to read. As it was I found the writing style consciously ""artistic"" or ""literary"" while the characters felt fake, superficial, and mechanical. I was too aware of the mechanics of the story and how he was manipulating the reader--kind of like going to a puppet show and having the puppeteer continually slipping and letting himself be seen. It kept knocking me out of the story.

Holocaust fiction is hard for me to read anyway, because it's an incredibly difficult period of history and human experience to read about. For me to want to read Holocaust fiction, it had better be better than okay, or even good--ti had better be absolutely amazing for me to be willing to put myself through the emotional pain and struggles that are inherent with a holocaust book. Real life is hard enough for me to get upset and stressed out by a mediocre book.

And please don't take that to mean that I only read books that are light and fluffy and safe, because I do read books that are hard, that are sad. But while some people same to take pleasure in reading a book just because it is sad (""Oh, this is a wonderful book! It made me cry!""), I don't enjoy crying in and of itself. For me to read a book that is heart wrenching, it had better offer me something besides an emotional train wreck--powerful characters I really care about, an engrossing story line, some new observation on human existence and human relations, something.

I do not usually read fiction to ""learn,"" per se--that is, if I wanted to learn more about the Holocaust, I'd read non-fiction accounts. I have read non-fiction accounts. I have read a few things of Holocaust fiction as well, and I have read some scholarly work as well. So it doesn't sell me on the book that it is a painful story, that it shows that some Germans were good and how social pressures created the Holocaust. I needed it to be a book about people that really interested me, that I cared about, and instead I was bored with the characters and irritated at the narrator and the obvious manipulations of the author. Instead of getting wrapped into the story, every night I when I was reading it I'd throw it down and vent for a half an hour to my husband about something that annoyed me. After a few nights of this, I realized that unless someone could convince me that the second half of the book was much better than the first that it just wasn't worth my time to finish.

'm not saying it's a bad book. So many people wouldn't love it if it were bad. But it really did not work for me.",,,"I had never read a John Green novel prior to reading this one. I wanted very much to like it and felt certain after reading some of the overwhelmingly positive reviews here that it would be an awesome and heartbreaking experience. I was ready and excited. I guess I could sum the experience up best by stating that it is unlikely I will read another book by this author, and if I do it will be sometime in the future when I forget how utterly disappointing I found this book to be. 

I had a lot of problems with this book. Overall, it felt very insincere and I was constantly distracted by how obviously everything was written with the goal of tugging on the reader's heart strings, rather than just letting things happen that were beautiful in spite of being sad. It felt like Mr. Green was screaming at me from the page 'ARE YOU SAD YET? YOU'RE SAD RIGHT? THIS IS SAD. YOU SHOULD FEEL ALL THE THINGS AND CRY ABOUT IT. I'M A GOOD WRITER. I WRITE FEELINGS. ARE YOU CRYING YET?' For a story about Human Beings, it doesn't feel very human at all. Instead everything feels very unnatural and self-conscious in the worst way.

The biggest and most impossible thing for me to get around was I simply didn't believe the character of Augustus or his relationship with main character Hazel. As these concepts  are basically what the entire story hinges upon, I didn't believe in or care about anything else that happened either. Augustus came off completely pretentious and obnoxious, particularly in the way he insisted on speaking in a Diablo Cody nerd hipster sort of dialect that no one would ever use in the real world. (Some commenters here have said it's the way Mr. Green himself talks which, a.) way to be self-congratulatory, and b.) how does he not get punched in the face, like, ALL THE TIME?) His entire character felt contrived and I never once felt a connection with him. Too often it seemed like he was walking around like I AM SO CLEVER LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME, constantly putting on a show so that nothing from him felt genuine or real. His whole fascination with ultimately meaningless metaphors felt condescending, like Mr. Green constantly squealing HEY GUYS, SEE WHAT I DID THERE? TAKE A SECOND, WRITE IT DOWN IF YOU NEED TO. YEAH, I'M DEEP. Augustus' one fault was sickness, but it was nothing that he could control. And that's just so... boring.

But it wasn't just Augustus. The character of Hazel was somewhat likable, (despite Mr. Green's insistance on making her 'sound like a teenager' by formating every other statement she makes like it's a question? and tacking distracting 'or whatever's onto the end of random bits of dialogue BECAUSE THIS IS HOW TEENAGERS TALK RIGHT? I CAN TALK LIKE A TEENAGER, SEE? BECAUSE THEY SAY 'WHATEVER'. I'M A GOOD WRITER. ARE YOU FEELING THINGS YET?) but her relationship with Augustus felt completely and totally forced. There was never any real reason for them to fall in love with one another, and that is crossing dangerously close into Twilight territory. He was so convienient, so effortless for Hazel. I had to wonder, was it him or was it because he was there and ready and willing? It all fell flat and left so many places to take the stories and facets of their characters completely unexplored. Any opportunities to delve into hard questions and real answers were left untaken and exchanged for large passages (mainly in the **SPOLIER ALERT**: Amsterdam trip scenes) that had very little purpose outside of screaming LOOK AT THIS HANDSOME CHARMING BOY ISN'T HE SWEET LADIES? HE WILL PULL YOUR CHAIR OUT FOR YOU AND HE TALKS LIKE I DO. IT'S CHARMING, RIGHT? YOU ARE FEELING CHARMED. I'M A GOOD WRITER. 

Ultimately, it felt completely fake. I couldn't get lost in it, always fully aware of the fact that I was reading fiction and how irritating EVERYTHING about it was. I finished it, which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars, but it was a true task. Truthfully, it pissed me off. I would have loved to love this book as much as everyone else and have a new favorite to hold dear to my heart. Now I'm just confused. Was my copy broken?","I was sure i'll like this book but it was so boring, long and uninteresting. The long descriptive pasages were the death of me! I read a paragraph and immediately forgot what it was about, which was pretty frustrating.

Not for me.","I'd known this was racist in a vague sort of way, not remembering much about the book or movie except bosoms and swooning, but wow, I didn't know it was that mindblowingly racist. The people who wanted to cut the n-word from Huckleberry Finn should all get together and have let's-set-Gone-With-The-Wind-on-fire parties. Man, if they applied their efforts to Gone With The Wind they could probably cut the book short by about a hundred pages.

I should say I like Scarlett as a character and found all the romance and striving bits interesting in themselves, but the book is sick through and through. It was very much worth reading. It's a bracing reminder of the wariness one should have of any nostalgia for false Arcadias.

Highlights include:
- Former slaveholders reproving Scarlett for hiring leased convicts to work on her mills. When Scarlett points out they were happy to use slave labour, they respond that their slaves weren't miserable! Narrative agrees! It's like satire, but it's not meant to be!
- In hunger and trepidation near the end of the war, Scarlett vows to herself that one day there'll be food on the table, her clothes will all be of silk, and black hands instead of white hands will pick the cotton on her plantation.
- Scarlett's lowest point is when she collapses in a slave garden and -- urgh, this part is too gross for me to even write it out. Urgh, I feel gross just remembering the line.
- Noble gentlemen whose lives have been uprooted and world turned upside down are forced in the nobility of their hearts and the staunchness of their pride to start a little club called the Ku Klux Klan. But they were forced to it! They had the best intentions!
- Ludicrous scene where Yankees are shown to be super racist against the black people they purported to want to free from slavery, whereas Southerners are good because they love their slaves and treat them like children as they should be treated.

Reading this was like being transported to an alternate universe where up was down, red was green, sweet was bitter and racist shit was not racist shit but a ~beautiful ideal~. I actually started worrying towards the end that I was going to come out of the book a more racist person.

After finishing it I felt a violent urge to read nonfiction, so I'm now reading bell hooks' Where We Stand: Class Matters and the Andayas' History of Malaysia. The stuff on alluvial deposits is particularly comforting.


One star for Scarlett and for the un-put-downable quality of the writing (it's throw-at-the-wallable, but I was never bored -- just furious). I'd give an extra star for her dynamic with Melanie which I kind of love (but what does it say when Scarlett comes off as LESS racist than Melanie because she buys into the poisonous ideals of the Confederacy less?), but I gotta do something to pull down this four star average.",,"Clueless. I am clueless. The popularity of this book baffles me even more than the popularity of The Fault in Our Stars. Maybe I really am just a coldhearted person with no feelings.

Amazingly, I actually managed to start The Perks of Being a Wallflower knowing absolutely nothing about it. I've avoided all the reviews and hype over the years, I've purposely put off seeing the movie because I wanted to check out the book first. I knew nothing except that so many people LOVE this book. I was a bit sceptical from the very first page when 15-year-old Charlie's narrative opened with short, choppy, fragmented sentences:

I don't think that there is a favorite kid in our family. There are three of us and I am the youngest. My brother is the oldest. He is a very good football player and likes his car. My sister is very pretty and mean to boys and she is in the middle.

But I perked up at the idea of reading a book by a narrator with obvious learning difficulties. One of my favourite parts of reading is getting to see the world through the eyes of someone whose perspective I might not have fully considered before. So I was willing to overlook the slightly annoying use of immature language and structure because I realised it was needed to get inside the narrator's head. Imagine my surprise and confusion when I discovered that not only does Charlie not have any learning difficulties, but he is actually considered ""intelligent beyond his years"", is apparently extremely talented and somehow manages to get straight-A grades. What????? And also how?????

It's like I'm missing something. I must be, right? Because to me this seems like nothing more than the usual melodramatic issue book, desperately trying to manipulate my emotions with the subtlety of a million flying bricks. There's suicide, sexual abuse, and domestic abuse crammed into the first few chapters. Is that not enough angst for you? Well, wait a few more chapters and we get drugs, incest, fights and first sexual experiences, told through the eyes of a guy who sounds about eight but is actually a teenager.

I didn't feel sad or moved or anything so, like I said, maybe this is a character flaw on my part. But I'm tired of reading books where I can feel the author's little voice screaming between the lines ""Cry! Look people are dying and it is so sad, cry! Look incest and prejudice and rape, cry!""

I felt nothing. Except maybe manipulated; yeah, I definitely felt manipulated.",Rochester abuses mentally ill wife. Jane complains a lot.,"I posted a scathing review of this book when I first read it - 13 years ago now! - while I was studying children's lit at uni. I kept getting narky comments from Percy Jackson fans with hurt feelings, so I decided to re-read the book and update my review. I stand by a lot of the things I said, but I've tried to express my views in a milder manner in order to avoid the PITCHFORKS (or should I say tridents, ho ho) from Team Percy.

With all the lofty maturity and perspective gained since 2010, I concede that it's probably not that bad. It's a quick easy read, fast-paced and entertaining, with a lot of wish-fulfillment-type stuff about an underdog kid getting his own back against bullies and singlehandedly taking on a bunch of monsters with great success. I can see why it's popular and I've happily recommended it to students before, despite my personal prejudice! But I still didn't love it, and I maintain that there are some things about it that are annoying.

Comparisons to the Harry Potter series are pretty inevitable considering when the book was published, which the author acknowledged in this blog post. Riordan said that Percy Jackson was 'in many ways' influenced by Harry Potter, and went on to defend some of the key similarities as drawing on the same mythology and containing the same universal themes. This is true, and perfectly legitimate. I have no problem with authors taking inspiration from the canon of existing literature - all fiction is essentially derivative, blah blah. I'm not going to whinge that he referenced the same mythological 3-headed dog (Cerberus/Fluffy) or used some of the same themes (hero's quest). The similarities I'm thinking of are more specific details. Things like:
• the trio of main characters includes a special chosen one with green eyes and black hair, his somewhat useless but funny & loyal best friend, and a smart/competent girl with curly hair.
• Percy/Harry has to stay with a horrible mortal/muggle relative (Gabe/the Dursleys) for his protection (scent/blood magic)
• Upon learning that he is special and not just unlucky, he goes to a magical school, invisible to mortals/muggles (Camp Half Blood/Hogwarts), where he is again under magical protection.
• The students are sorted into teams and there's one noticeably evil team (Ares/Slytherin). There's a strong rivalry between the evil team and the team our hero is on, which leads to fierce competition in games (Capture the flag/Quidditch)
• One of the main antagonists (Clarisse/Draco) is from the evil team, and we later find out has a bit of a bully for a dad (Ares/Lucius)
• The hero finds he can understand a language without learning it (Ancient Greek - and also speaking to horses/Parseltongue)
• An ordinary muggle train station takes you to the entrance of Mt Olympus/Hogwarts.
• The main villain (Kronos/Voldemort) has been in a weakened or near-defeated state due to being ripped into pieces but is regaining power
• There is a prophecy saying (Percy/Harry) will defeat (Kronos/Voldemort) - but it could refer to someone else.
• Some very similar phrasing at times, for example in the scene where the mean teacher (Mr D/Snape) greets (Percy/Harry) by sneering ""well well, our little celebrity"". And the term ""half-blood"". Personally, I think he should have gone with ""demigod"", which is both a cooler word AND a more accurate description of what they are.

I'm not saying I think Riordan intentionally set out to rip Harry Potter off. I just suspect he had the book in his memory when writing and subconsciously mimicked some aspects. HOWEVER, I freely accept that others may consider the similarities either coincidental or sufficiently different to render them unique.

Another thing I mentioned in my original review was the link between ugliness and evil. This still stood out to me on a second reading - possibly only because I remembered it and was looking for it. Some examples are Percy's bully Nancy Bobofit, who has ""crooked teeth"" and ""orange freckles like she's been sprayed with liquid Cheetos"" and has a posse of ""ugly friends"", Clarisse is a ""big ugly girl"" who looks like she ""wears a size XXXL shirt"" and has ""stringy hair"" and ""ugly pig eyes"". The Ares team is full of the ""biggest and ugliest kids"", who live in an ""ugly red cabin"" and their table gives ""an ugly cheer"". Percy's horrible stepdad Gabe's last name is Ugliano and he is described as ugly, balding & overweight. In a combat Percy refers to his opponents as ""Ugly One, Ugly Two"" etc. Meanwhile, Annabeth is ""pretty"" with ""curly blonde hair like Cinderella"" and Percy is a ""good-looking kid"" and has a ""handsome"" face. To be fair, this book certainly isn't the only culprit, but I don't think it's a particularly good message. It probably resonates with preteens, at that age they might find it satisfying to have ugliness sneered at without being told it's unkind/unfair.

I still found Percy a bit too effortlessly awesome. He's often described as guessing or instinctively knowing what to do, without having to come up with ideas, especially in battle. Feeling angry causes him to channel some sort of combat mode where he can perform skills he's never practiced, such as when he disarms Luke in training. ""My body thought for me"" he'll say as he ducks a fatal blow then makes a wild unplanned swing with his sword that somehow not only connects but slices a monster in half. He can beat Ares, the actual god of war, in one-on-one combat. He can saunter into the Underworld without any kind of plan, bribe his way in with money and flattery, have a casual chat to Hades, and then escape with his two friends unharmed. He automatically understands Ancient Greek because his brain is ''hardwired'' for it, and can speak to horses because his father created them. He often has a feeling of danger or a sense that something's wrong (although he never acts on this and plunges in anyway, every. single. time.) and guesses or figures out stuff based on VERY scant evidence. I mean yes, it makes sense in the fiction - he's a demigod, so he's supposed to be born with supernatural powers - but I think it makes him a shallower and less interesting character. In general, I thought the action moved on a bit too quickly to leave much time for any deep conversations or character development, but that's a complaint I often have about teen fiction. I think a lot of authors incorrectly assume their audience won't have the patience for a slower and more thoughtful pace.

My final complaint - a NEW one! - was that I didn't buy the underlying premise. The ancient Greek gods are still around but have moved with the times, hide most of their doings from mortals now using 'Mist', and shift their headquarters to wherever the ""pinnacle of western civilization"" is (America, natch) but they've kept all the same customs, weapons, language, building styles etc that they had in Greece. Well, ok, but what about all the gods of other ancient civilizations? Baal, Ra, Thor, Ishtar, Brahma, Shangti - were they also real? Are they other names for the same guys? Why did they choose to go with the Greek theme if they existed before and after that time? It was never explained. Maybe he'll talk about it in one of the next books in the series but I don't intend to read them so I'll never know.",,"My star rating is purely subjective and means only what GR says it means: I didn't like it. It didn't mean anything to me, sadly, and I didn't even find it to be an interesting story. I'm not saying it's a terrible book; in fact, I'd be very interested to hear what others think (reviews are a bit light for this book here I see).

First, I have a confession to make: I got two thirds of the way through and skimmed the rest. Well, worse than that: I flipped through and got the gist, but such is the way it's written you can't even skim. I just really had to put the book to rest, and it made me feel miserable thinking about making myself keep reading it. Reading should never make you miserable, so I did something I rarely ever do, and it nags at me but, well, there you have it.

The premise sounds interesting, and I had high hopes it would be one that would suck me in and captivate me. It's not that I had particularly high expectations - I didn't really have any expectations, though I thought it might be heavy on the intellectual side of things - but it was apparent from fairly early on that it wasn't going to be my kind of book.

It's Petersburg and a young student, Raskolnikov, is pawning his only valuables to an old crone, Alyona Ivanovna, who lives in a small apartment with her sister Lizaveta. He hasn't been able to afford to go to uni in several months, and his dress and manner makes him seem even lower class than he is. In desperation he hatches a plan to murder Alyona and rob her. He carries this out, killing not just her but her simple-minded sister who returns home unexpectedly, and in his fear and haste flees the scene with only some pawned trinkets and a small pouch.

His guilt manifests itself in fever and delirium, and he behaves very strangely thereafter. His friend and fellow student, Razumikhin, puts up with an awful lot and generously gives his time and efforts to help Raskolnikov; his mother, Pulcheria Alexandrovna and his sister, Dunechka, come to town to prepare for Dunya's marriage to an odious man; and Raskolnikov becomes somewhat obsessed with the family of a poor alcoholic who dies early on, in particular his eldest daughter Sonya, who had to become a prostitute in order to make some money for her family.

There's a lot of twoing and froing, a lot of agonising on Raskolnikov's part, and a lot of exclaiming. I wouldn't even have minded but Raskolnikov became such a bore, I didn't even want to slap, I just wanted to ignore him. It comes down mostly to the way it was written, which I didn't care for and which made the book a real slog.

I know this is some kind of work of genius, but if that's true, then I just felt stupid. It all seemed pretty obvious to me. No doubt if I made the effort I could see something special here, but it's like The Red and the Black - other people find the psychological melodrama truly fascinating, but to me, it's just melodrama, which I loathe. There's also no mystery, and not much suspense. There's a somewhat clever police inspector investigating the murder, but the game of cat-and-mouse the blurb enticed me with fell flat pretty quickly, and there was nothing left to hold me.

The blurb describes the book as ""a preternaturally acute investigation of the forces that impel a man toward sin, suffering and grace."" Uh huh. You can tell I'm really impressed can't you? It reads more like an account of a man going mad and being really self-centred, but after my sorry lack of appreciation for the equally masterful The Red and the Black, is it any surprise that I didn't like this book at all? If you're looking for a good story, this isn't it.","There's nothing positive about this book, so let's just go straight in to why it was so bad.

The narrative was unbelievable. And I don't mean ""OMGA DID YOU SEE THAT?"" kind of unbelievable, I mean it was so unconvincing it was dire. At not point did it feel like a woman, a Geisha, a girl, a human being was telling me a story. It felt so flat and boring and my gosh, she was tedious. She had the emotional range of an egg.

The world description was non-existent. The beginning, when we are in the Japanese countryside, was the only part that was descriptive: we had a lovely house and lovely scenery, and then we moved to Tokyo and all of a sudden it's just grey and stone, and that's it. And oddly empty of people. No atmosphere, no city scenery; it was vague at best. It could have still been happening in the fish factory.

There also needs to be an amendment to the Bechdel Test. 3.1: Two women have a conversation about something that isn't just bitching about other women.

And, whilst I don't agree that ""culture"" automatically means you forgive something, and I realise it was a different time and a different place, but I don't want to read about creepy old men who creep about pubic hair growing on twelve year olds' vaginas. I just don't.

And I know this is the most unhinged and incoherent review ever, but I also didn't find myself learning anything particular about Geisha. In fact, I'd agree with most other reviewers and say it was far too Westernised and almost Romanticised.

Fun Fact Amendment: All Geisha were originally men. Think about that.","War & Peace seemed 1000 pages too short. This book, unfortunately seemed 1000 pages too long. Victor, do we really need 4 full chapters about the sewers of Paris and the poetic side of excrement? And are we really supposed to believe that of all the thugs, thieves, murderers and other scoundrels haunting Paris, the one guy Inspector Javert is really intent on capturing is the guy who stole a loaf of bread 20-30 years before? Yeah, I get it--the French legal system was unfair, but c'mon--this is ridiculous.",,,"Pure and utter crap. I wish there were ways to give negative stars. I certainly want the time from my life back. I would compare its writing quality to a fanzine, except that comparison wouldn't be fair to fanzines. But I swear to God, it took every single bad fanfic writing cliche and published them. What were her publishers thinking??? Where was her editor?? It was horrible.

I would dearly love for a fanfiction author to make good and become a published writer, but I'd prefer one with talent, thanks.","While it was a well-written effort, I didn't find it as breathtaking as the rest of the world. It more or less rubbed me the wrong way. It reads like the musings of a white woman attempting to have an uncomfortable conversation, without really wanting to be uncomfortable. It's incredibly hard to write with integrity about race and be completely honest and vulnerable. The author failed to make me believe she was doing anything beyond a show & tell. And if her intent isn't anything greater, then it makes this book all the more pandering to the white imagination of what it must have been like to be ""the help"" during that era. It's passive self-reflection at best and utterly useless.

The national fascination with this book makes me sick. It makes me think of my grandmother who was ""the help"" to many white families for well over 50 years. Her stories aren't too different from those told in this book, but they are hers to tell. If she were alive today, I don't believe she would praise Stockett's book. In fact, I think she we would be horrified at the thought that her years of hard work (in some cases, for some very horrible people) would be reduced to some wannabe feel good story of the past.","Friend John, this should have been a short story!

Dracula is a spooky story which begins with Jonathan Harker, an attorney who travels to Transylvania to help his client, Count Dracula, purchase a home in London. However, Dracula is behaving strangely. Will Jonathan make it out alive?

Holy smokes! This book is B-O-R-I-N-G! No wonder there are so many Dracula books and movies because almost anyone else could have done it better!

The book itself has an interesting format—it is told through various characters’ journals, telegrams, and letters.

But---oh, the writing style! Huge, long, gigantic paragraphs! Dracula reminded me of The Scarlett Letter because, although it did have some interesting elements, it was so long and drawn out. If the filler was cut out, it would have made a compelling short story.

“Friend John” was mentioned so many times…….

This is a book that is so poorly written that I am confident that I could write something better. Apparently, I am not alone in this thought as there have been many, many other versions.","This is a novel that blows past conventional ideas like ""disbelief."" Apparently humanity, a species whose only real claim to fame is war, now stinks at war, and can only be saved by a child genius who is one part prophecy, one part bad science, and one part wish-fulfillment. Thanks to this plan, we are treated to a gaggle of super-intelligent children who seldom appear particularly clever (in fact many behave with adult maturity rather than abnormal intellect) and achieve greatness not through any great effort that we follow (rather you'll read recaps of their successful efforts), but because the author wants them to achieve these things. In this, the definitive edition of Ender's Game, there is almost nothing earned within the plot.

It's a decent story, but for a book with so many events there is very little consequence or risk, and the character development is so linear and stale. That last quality is particularly cloying considering that, prodigies or not, most of the characters are children and at least one of them should develop in an unexpected way. Instead the unexpected developments we get are humorlessly absurd, like two prodigies fooling the world with a fake op-ed column that earns them political power. The ending is predictable and deliberately anti-climactic, robbing the novel of its one true punch. The trade-off is, instead of getting the thing the book was building to, you get the opportunity for sequels and spin-offs. If you liked the infallible, mostly emotionless and paper-thin protagonist, then that's a good thing. If you were hoping to have the hours you put into the book validated with some real emotion at the end, well, neither this author's definitive edition nor any other is going to help you.",
I am now stupider from reading this.,,"If I could take any book off the high-school curriculum, it would be this one. Look down on me all you want, but this is not ""great American literature"". Why?

1. It is as trite and cliche as most ""coming-of-age"" stories - I think we all got sick of those long before we hit our teens. This one doesn't even tackle the confusion of identity, sexuality, spirituality that most teen books cover. Let me put it this way: there are good books about racial issues, but if that's the only subject in the book, they become a one-trick pony.

2. The characters are one-sided caricatures who manage to stay the same from beginning to end.

3. Portraying the black defendant as a naive, simple, and innocent child manipulated by a scheming white girl is racist in itself - am I the only one to notice this? Uncle Tom didn't need to be relocated into the fifties.

I had to write this review simply because I can't stand by and watch this piece of sentimental trash be voted one of the best books of all time. I would dearly love to pull this book out of the high school curriculum and replace it with Robert Heinlein's ""Stranger in a Strange Land"", which used to be taught until enough parents became afraid that their children might actually think in school.","I hated this book. There is so much I disliked about it that I'm not sure where to begin. I recognize that I am in the minority on this one and that many of my GR friends loved this novel, so there's no need to start screaming at me in the comments. This book just wasn't my cuppa, and that's OK. We're allowed to like different books.

My List
I think the thing I hated the most was the writing itself. The sentences were rough, uneven and felt unfinished.

I hated that even though the sentences and chapters were short and choppy, the book was 550 pages long! Two hundred pages could have been cut from this sucker, easily.

I hated how Zusak wrote the narrator Death, and how Death was constantly foreshadowing things. Dude, I get it, you're omniscient.

I hated that Zusak chose to put his cliched story about a girl who likes books against the backdrop of the Holocaust. It seemed like the author was milking a tragedy to try and make his book seem deeper than it is.

I hated that every scene was precious, oh so schmaltzy and precious!

I hated that the characters were all two-dimensional and none of them seemed real. They were just a collection of anecdotes.

I hated that the entire book felt like a pretentious writing exercise by some smarmy grad student.

This is the second YA novel that I've hated this year, and I'm taking a break from the genre. I don't need books that are dumbed down. I like complex stories and characters, and beautiful writing that makes me want to underline passages. There wasn't a single sentence in The Book Thief that made me pause and appreciate its construction. Not one.",,,"I can be honest, right? After all, it was I who spent time reading this book.

I guess it has something to do with the fact that so many friends and relatives raved about this book being sad and great prior to my reading. For example, an 8-year old niece of my wife said that she cried while reading the book because it is about teenagers with cancer. Then of course most of my GR friends, foreigners and locals alike, rated this book with either 4 or 5 stars.

So, when I started reading this book, I thought I already clammed up. Maybe I was just trying to be different or I would like to show my wife's 8-y/o niece that the book is YA and I am too old (mature) compared to her and have outgrown books like this and definitely would not cry over some silly stories about lovers with cancer.

My Dad died of brain cancer in 1997 so definitely I have a big compassion for people suffering from any kind of cancer. However, what is John Green's purpose of using cancer has a major element in this book's romance? Obviously, it is to manipulate people's emotion. It is to gain sympathy because his female readers would like to cry buckets of tears especially if the guy is as good-looking as Augustus the apple of the eyes of our heroine who is also cancer-stricken, Hazel. I mean cancer, like death, is something that we normally don't want to talk about and if we need to talk about it, we usually have a purpose. Sadly, in my opinion, John Green has no particular purpose but for commercial reason: to generate sympathy that means more readers, more sales, more money to bring to the bank.

There is nothing new in this book. Hazel's I want to leave a mark prior to dying is everybody's wish really. Augustus' I am not my cancer is too heroic. We all know that it is not true, we all got our big frustrations or lost in lives. We all have been sick at some point in our lives and we go through a period of denial and even if we say we accepted everything, we always keep on hoping that the sickness or the problem would disappear that's why we continuously pray to God. I mean the acceptance is there and we are at peace with ourselves but still call God to interfere and take the sickness away.

I just did not feel anything reading this book except the feeling of being manipulated. It's too pretentious and gimmicky. I know John Green is laughing his way to the bank especially because some movie people took advantage of this book's popularity so this even has a big screen adaptation. My goodness.","Let me cut to the chase: this is a terrible book, written for bad people.

Sure, some people will argue that The Picture of Dorian Gray is a classic, etc. etc., but it doesn't take a genius to sort out that canonization isn't any more indication of a novel's quality than it's present-day popularity. (In fact, one could argue, canonization is just a form of present-day popularity, but that's another story.)

At it's core, The Picture of Dorian Gray revolves around a fairly trite Gothic plot that could sustain a reasonably entertaining tale of, say, 8-12 pages. Unfortunately, Wilde decided to continue writing for another 200-odd pages motivated, apparently, by his need to wedge in a certain number of witty one-liners and convey some Big Ideas.

There's no denying that Wilde's one-liners are, indeed, witty: the only problem is that they often come at the expense of what little naturalness existed in his incredibly melodramatic, overwrought prose, so that the direction of a scene or conversation is horribly distorted to accommodate a certain bon mot. Worse yet, in the context of Serious Writing, these quips often fall flat under their (supposed) intellectual burden rather than existing as they should: as pretty, essentially empty ornamentation, which is one reason why Wilde's comic plays succeed far better than this atrocity of literature.

Allegedly, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a complex novel of ideas but apparently I was too dense to find those Deep Thoughts. Ultimately this book is nothing more than a paean to cynicism and despair. Conventional morality and society, Wilde argues, is hollow and hypocritical; the few ""good"" characters in this book (Basil Hallward, etc.) are weak and sentimental. At the same time, rejecting morality in favor of hedonism leads inescapably to guilt, punishment and ruin (the fate of Dorian Gray). Thus, ultimately, the only reasonable course of action (according to Wilde) seems to be that of Lord Henry Wotton: disdain for the world and detachment from line, punctuated by the occasional witticism along the way.

In short, both as an ideological treatise and a (so-called) work of art The Picture of Dorian Gray reads most of all as an advertisement for suicide.","Is it the stream of consciousness?
Oh, why was he so handsomely blond, so courteously aloof, so maddeningly boring with his talk about Europe and books and music and poetry and things that interested her not at all – and yet so desirable? Night after night, when Scarlett went to bed after sitting on the front porch in the semi-darkness with him, she tossed restlessly for hours and comforted herself only with the thought that the very next time he saw her he certainly would propose. But the next time came and went, and the result was nothing – nothing except that the fever possessing her rose higher and hotter.

Charlie is a freshman, a loner and an odd duck, all wrapped up in one stunningly awkward package.

How awkward? Cripplingly so.
I am very interested and fascinated how everyone loves each other, but no one really likes each other.
He's always been a bit....out there...but his family knows how to handle his moods and step around his antics.
So, this is my life. And I want you to know that I am both happy and sad and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be.
Only, he's now in high school, and the things he would get away with in middle school aren't exactly going to fly now that he's in the big leagues, and he's having difficulties adjusting.

Luckily, he met Sam and and a few other friends...and with them, things are finally looking up.

So.

Sooooo.

Sooooooooooooooo.......here's my problems with this novel - it ticks too many boxes, The Charlie Cringe and I honestly thought the novel was going a completely different direction.

This book ticks too many boxes - aka is there anything NOT covered in here?

It feels like the author googled ""Most traumatizing teen issues"" and then, looking at the list of twenty-or-so of them, says, ""F*ck it. I'll throw them all in.""

I mean, really.

Does anyone expect to adequately cover suicide, mental illness, alcohol, drugs, sexual orientation, first-time-sex, incest, abuse, rape, and more in a single 200ish page novel?

That's right, you can't.

But you can sure as hell definitely cram all of those buzzwords into one book and throw in a few fancy-sounding quotes, like this:
We accept the love we think we deserve.
and this:
And in that moment, I swear we were infinite.
And boom. Instant classic.

The audience is shuffled from one BIG issue to the next BIG thing without any development.

That's what frustrated me so much - we have these huge, hard-hitting issues...and nothing is dealt with.

The Charlie Cringe - aka holy sh*t that's a lot of crinnnnge.

And Charlie, while he is cute and adorable, his whole character just didn't feel authentic to me - the dialogue, the actions, the issues.

And I'm speaking from the perspective of a wallflower - I was a quiet kid but I was NO where near Charlie-level crinnnge.

Okay. You may be wondering, what level of cringe are we talking about?

He's blessed by the two coolest kids in the school taking him under their wing and made him their best friend.

Personally, I find that the odds that these two popular senior kids adopting the cripplingly awkward freshman to be astronomical...but hey, it's fiction.

Anyway, Charlie feels like he can say anything on his mind to these seniors. And what does he tell them?

Everything.

And by everything, I mean EVERYTHING.

For example, he confesses a sex dream about one of them to their face because he felt guilty. And they find it charming.

Just. What the what?

Is this really supposed to be high school?

I'm just like...I may have been a wallflower, but thank GOD I wasn't this bad of a wallflower.

I honestly thought the novel was going a completely different direction - aka am I the only one?

Charlie supposed to be this super smart kid, with reading comprehension off the charts (based on the English essays he writes).

...but his monologue sounds like an eight-year-old with a bucket of sugar and a microphone.

How can you write essay after essay on great and notable works of English that absolutely boggle the mind of your teacher...and when you pen a letter, you sound like this:
I don’t know if you’ve ever felt like that. That you wanted to sleep for a thousand years. Or just not exist. Or just not be aware that you do exist. Or something like that. I think wanting that is very morbid, but I want it when I get like this. That’s why I’m trying not to think. I just want it all to stop spinning
or like this:
And I thought about how many people have loved those songs. And how many people got through a lot of bad times because of those songs. And how many people enjoyed good times with those songs. And how much those songs really mean. I think it would be great to have written one of those songs. I bet if I wrote one of them, I would be very proud.
Honestly, for the first 2/3 I thought he was slow or autistic and this is one of those books where everyone knows but the kid (and he finds out in some hugely traumatizing way).

I mean, the signs were all there.

He has emotional episodes, monologues like he's half his age and just seems so spaced out all the time.

At one point, he watches a drunk girl get raped (forced to give a blow job to a much more sober guy).

And by watches - he's in the same room, silently staring from a corner - doesn't intervene or do anything other than watch. AND he only realizes she got raped weeks later.

How is this kid classified only as a wallflower?

I really, truly thought we were going to find out that the popular kids were only nice to him because he was ""special"" - honestly, am I the only one who had these thoughts? Am I just going completely left-field on this book?

Jeez.

Ah well, I don't know, maybe it's just me but I'm really (really) grateful there isn't a sequel.","This Story Sucks

Now I know why I don’t like classics. They are stuffy, stiff, superficial and sophisticate, all adjectives that I dislike. As for this story, well, is she walking through Mongolia or kayaking the Arctic? Is she a pioneer woman? No, she is learning to become a lady. And now she is living in a mansion, teaching a little girl how to become a lady as well as schooling her, for she is a nanny, and as a nanny, as in all of these kinds of books, she will fall in love with the owner of said mansion or some other wealthy man. It is the old Cinderella story, but maybe this story came first. You get a proper education, like finishing school, and after you have learned to become a lady and even studied French, you can marry a wealthy man, because it is wealth that is important. It is this type of story that has brought ruin to others. And this style of writing is why I hate classics. It makes them tedious and boring.","Wow. Here we go.

Dnf at 30%

I tried, really tried to get into this book. I just don't get the hype, and I couldn't torture myself with having to read about Percy and his pea-sized brain anymore.

The cons just far outweighed the pros, and trust me, I was keeping track.

This isn't my first time reading this book, and the first time I read it, I didn't like it either. I've also watched the movie and the show, and I will say, the movie was worse (if that's even possible) and the show was pretty decent. (But I may just be biased towards Walker Scobell, I dunno.)

But when I first read this book, I was the target age. I was 13. But for some reason, I just had this weird feeling about this book that I couldn't figure out until now.

The book is childish. (And that's coming from someone who loves children and middle grade books.) Everything- the writing, the dialogue, the plot, and the EXTREMELY unrealistic scenes. And before someone gets mad and says WeLl ItS GrEeK mYtHoLoGy, ofc it's not realistic. I would like to point out, that's not what I'm saying.

It tried, it really did, but it just didn't hit at all.

So here are some quotes that royally pissed me off in every way you can imagine- some because the lines were just stupid, some because Percy was stupid, and some because the writing was just not funny. I went light on you guys and only listed a few that bugged me. (Completely out of context btw)

""twenty-eight mental-case kids""

""Or worse, they were going to make me read the book.""
OH NO!!! ??

""My mother teaches me bullfighting.""

""His music was causing lines of bugs to leave the strawberry patch in every direction, like refugees fleeing a fire.""
I'm sorry, Percy, but I don't find your little refugee analogy very funny.

""I become supreme lord of the bathroom.
What? Stfu Percy.

""No,"" I said, recovering my wits. ""It explains the bad smell.""
Ohhhh. So you WANT Clarisse to beat you up?

I vividly remember cringing at other lines later in the book, but I didn't get that far.

Now for some things in this book that just didn't make sense (remember, this is me at 30%- bear with me)

1- Why, in god's name, would Mr. Brunner just give Percy a sword and roll away? Like, the kid is TWELVE! I don't care if you think he's a demi-god. It's weird. Bro's getting attacked by a winged demon from the depths of hell and you give him this pen-sword acting like he's going to know how to defend himself? What???

2- And about that- how the HELL did Percy win that fight?? And the one with the Minotaur?? Like, do I have to remind you that Percy is TWELVE?? I don't care if him being a demi-god gives him 'strength' or whatever. He's never had training AND these monsters had the upper hand. He should have died in chapter one. Just saying.

3-I didn't get to this part of the story yet, but I remember it. How the fuck does little Percy beat the freaking GOD OF WAR in a fight???? HUHH??? He's the god of war!!! Oh, ok, you splashed him with a little wave. Of COURSE that's gonna render the god of freaking war helpless. It all makes sense now.
Do you see how stupid this sounds?

4-This book was just plain boring. The fighting scenes had close to zero description, scratch that- the entire BOOK had close to zero description- and it made everything very anticlimactic and dry. And this is supposed to be an adventure novel? Yeah, ok bud.

5-Why did everyone just collectively decide to gaslight Percy about Mrs. Dodds? Yeah, ok, let's just keep the kid, whose life is in danger, in the dark about everything happening to him. That makes total sense.

6-Why did everyone just breeze past Percy's mother literally disintegrating in front of his very eyes??? The kid is scared. But nope, let's show him around camp half-blood and act like nothing even happened. What a great way to waste my time.

7-Idek why Percy was so surprised about his dad being absent. Excuse me Percy, but he's a literal GOD. He has other things to worry about other than his little accident- aka, YOU. And frankly, so do I.

8-Annabeth. Just Annabeth. Whiny, annoying little entitled brat.

And that was only a few inconsistencies- let's move on.

Don't worry, all my Percy Jackson lovers out there- here are some quotes I actually did like!

""You should've seen him run when it was enchilada day in the cafeteria.""

""Please explain why Kronos ate his kids.""

""Maybe if I kick you in your soft spot, I thought. And make you sing soprano for a week.""

""I'm sorry, I did not trust Chiron's back end the way I trusted his front.""

""the stables (which Chiron didn't seem to like very much)""

""When we reached her, she looked me over critically, like she was still thinking about how much I drooled.""

""So naturally I tripped coming in the door and made a total fool of myself.""

""Monsters don't die, Percy. They can be killed. But they don't die.""
""Oh, thanks. That clears it up.""

""You want to gargle with toilet water again, Clarisse? Close your mouth.""

All in all, I came into this book wanting to enjoy it. But no matter what, I just couldn't. I hope all my besties who truly loved this book won't hate me forever.",,"Holy shit this was so boring I wanted Raskolnikov to murder me and put me out my misery. I didn't like it from the opening page and felt the same way to the very end. Why did I endure such self flagellation you ask? I did it for the sake of ""The Classic"" novel. When will I learn?","This is not a memoir. Do your research people! Arthur Golden invented it all, and shamelessly used up Mineko (the retired geisha) who trusted him enough to tell him her life story. A real story and not the fiction printed on these pages. Mineko received death threats because of his lies. These are serious things. Many Asian women were sexually assaulted by Western man because of books like this one, books that paint them as promiscuous prostitutes.

This author was sued for breach of contract for mentioning Mineko in the acknowledgements and as they came to some kind of agreement in the court, I don't think the author still advertises this novel as a true story, but didn't he use to do in the past? At any rate, a lot of people think that was Golden wrote was based on a real life account and that is definitely not the case.

What do I think about his actions? Not only did the author trivialize and insult Japanese culture but he invented the whole thing. It is fiction, not memoir. Obviously nobody cares about that. What interest me is how readers be so stupid (or perhaps better to say culture ignorant) as to think this is a memoir? Haven't you noticed passages literally rewritten from Gone with the Wind? That episode when the heroine hides her hands after having to work during the war. Gone With the Wind rip off for sure. There are other Western movie references that I can think of but forgive me if I don't feel too inclined to overly analyze this excuse for a novel.

So, what do I think about this novel? If the author wasn't so immoral in advertising it falsely, had he been clear it was all invention- it would still be a terrible and shameless book. I mean maybe I could give it two stars if it was placed in an imaginary land. The story isn't great as such, but apart from being wildly racist, it's somewhat readable. Nevertheless, it is a shameless and racist attack on Japanese culture. The author should be ashamed of himself.",Life is miserable and then you die.,,,"Really, there's nothing very original, or satisfying in the book. She borrowed so heavily from Buffy, Harry Potter, and Star Wars that it sticks out like a sore thumb. It reads like altered fan fiction. And I love fan fiction, make no mistake, but it's not attempting to make a buck off someone else's world, either. Which is essentially what the book is. Cobbled fan fiction that has no cohesion.

I knew Clare as Cassandra Claire from Harry Potter fandom, I will admit, and that did color somewhat. But no matter the reputation, my review still stands. The blatant borrowing and cobbling jarred me from the story multiple times. As I said in another review, ""most likely would have still come to the same conclusions, due to the heavy-handed writing and knowing some of the more obvious media nods.

""For instance, the Silent Brothers kept reminding me of the Bringers in season seven of Buffy, the Vampire Slayer and the Dementors in Harry Potter mixed with a little bit of monks and made goodish. Yeah. Very hard to take them seriously. And people have repeatedly mentioned Sirius's flying motorcycle, which has been labeled a ""demon motorcycle."" That kinda reminded me of Anne Bishop's book Sebastian, which I put down to read City of Bones, because of the fact she has motorcycles that are run by demons, not for them. But still, it's obviously not something original, even though it plays a fairly important role in several scenes.""

I truly am glad I obtained the copy from the library and not purchased. I would have been irate over the 14 dollars that I would have lost. It did not inspire me to read the other two in the series. After all, I didn't spend money, so I would have been more willing to read the book. Now? Not a chance in Hades, even if it were frozen over with pink slushie.","I don't think this could be any more obvious, trite and cliche-ridden. The book's only aim is to make white people feel better about themselves (you know, that same old a-brave-white-lady-savior story you've read and a few dozen times before). Guess it worked. Again.","After reading Dracula, I realized that just because something is considered a classic, doesn't mean it can't be shit.

For the most part, I didn't really know what was going on. The characters talk like Yoda from Star Wars sometimes (Yes, I'm aware the original publication was 1897, and it's written in old-English of sorts. But, still.)

Yes, it had its moments. It even had a quote or two that I put up on my blog because I thought, hey! That's a really awesome quote! But overall, it was shit.

Ladies and gentlemen of Goodreads, if you value your sanity, do not read this book.","Ugh. Okay. I'm officially giving up on this one.

So, a little disclaimer here. I do not like Orson Scott Card. As a person. I think he's a shitty human who's used his award-winning author status as a platform to advocate the denial of other humans' rights. This is detestable to me.

But that is not why I rated this book 1 star.

The reason I gave this book 1 star, and have given up even trying to read it, is because I do not like Orson Scott Card. As an author. This was the second book of his I've read - or tried to read- and it will most assuredly be my last. I finished the other one, but can't say I liked it, though it was... interesting. This one I just couldn't even muster up any meh over, and it's supposedly his best work. I disliked it almost immediately.

I made it about 15%, and I've read about all I can stands, I can't stands no more.

The writing is awful. We're told what Ender thinks. We're told what Ender feels, and does, and says, and why, and despite supposedly being in his head, I don't understand or like him at all. We're told he's a genius. We're told he's mastered calculus as a toddler, that he can hack school computers with ease. We're told that he plays game A. Then he beats it, and plays game B. In every game, the goal is conquer and kill, and he's the best at it. But we're told that Ender does that only when he's forced... but then we're told that he likes it - no he doesn't! - yes he does. He stabs the game giant in the eye and likes it, and then when the giant is 'dead' and no longer an obstacle, out of boredom, he wishes he could murder it again. Because he liked it. That's why he's The One. Duh.

The ridiculous chapter-leading nameless dialogues are terrible and jarring and distracting, and they take me out of the story. Which is a very bad thing when I'm disliking and uninterested in the story as it is.

The complete lack of characterization is shameful. These kids, and especially Ender, who is SIX YEARS OLD and likes to throw the N-word around like it's a frisbee, sound like adults that I wouldn't even want to talk to, let alone root for. I don't like, understand, or care about a single character in this book. Not one. Wait, I might like the Buggers, but that's only because I feel like they have to be decent if they want to rid the universe of this society of sociopaths and groomed killer children.

Then there's the fact that I'm apparently supposed to believe that a society as advanced as this one, with space travel, in-body monitoring of thoughts and actions of their potential recruits, the ability to at least partially coax out genius children by specialized breeding, etc, would be so casually dismissive of female potential as to respond to a question regarding whether there will be girls at this murder-camp with ""A few girls. They don't often pass the tests to get in. Too many centuries of evolution are working against them."" Because, apparently, only Y chromosomes can carry intelligence and females are just sub-par, even at evolution. How can they be a war leader and savior of humanity if they can't even master upward evolution, like males have?

Oh, but wait... which entry tests were those again? The ones that require extreme violence? Stomping the shit out of another kid, albeit a bully, was the only test-like thing I saw that earned Ender a spot at murder-school. And it's OKAY that Ender put him in the hospital, because he was forced to do it or keep being bullied. There was no other solution. So maybe that little comment was a backhanded compliment to us of the gentler, weaker sex. Our delicate sensibilities just don't automatically run to murderdeathkill at the slightest provocation, which from what I can tell makes females completely valueless except as future-soldier-makers, so yeah, I guess we fail. Darn!

I don't buy the concept of putting all of the eggs of an apparently critically endangered humanity into a single basket that consists of a child 4 years away from attaining the glorious achievement of double digit age. But wait, this war is apparently on hold while this generation of future soldiers grows up? How awesomely considerate of the ""Buggers"". I now see why they must die. /sarcasm

Which brings me to the ""Buggers"". They are aliens. Got that. Apparently, there's no possibility of aliens NOT wanting to wipe out all of humanity... because, you know, the universe isn't big enough for the both of us. I was really, really hoping for a plausible reason why these aliens would want to kill people, but I got nada. Perhaps it's explained later. Or maybe this is just fear and hatred of the unknown. I don't know, and frankly don't care all that much, but it just feels like we're supposed to just go along with the story that implies that different = bad and must be killed.

I'm not squeamish or tender-hearted. I fully believe in killing off characters that need to die, even and especially if it's painful to the reader. Violence, in general, doesn't bother me, and I have no trouble reading about abuse, or death, or destruction, or brutality. But it needs to have a purpose and reason for existing on the page. It needs to be honest, and realistic, and plausible. And I didn't feel like that was the case here. It felt like it was for pure shock value here, placed with ever more aggressive offensiveness with the hopes of a reaction. ""OMG! they are just babies! Oh the brutality! Won't someone save the children?!"" And it worked, because my reaction is to stop reading this shit called a book. The racism, misogyny, hatred of the 'different', the adult condoned and encouraged cruelty and alienation of weaker or smaller children, the violence and genocidal-tendencies in a 6 year old all made me hate every minute I spent reading, or avoiding, this book, and only confirmed that Orson Scott Card is not someone whose work I will ever read or watch again.

I could go on, but I'm done with this book. Writing it off and washing my hands because they feel like they've been holding something disgusting and slimy. I haven't seen anything even remotely redeeming in this book, nothing that makes me think that the rest of it would be worth my time, and I'm done.",
"I find the premise of children killing children to be horrendous. The fact that this book was so popular among children is equally horrendous.

What is omitted from Hunger Games is also a problem.

(1) There is no discussion of who is wielding the power to make children murderers, nor how they got that power.

(2) Other than a single line, I can't recall any hint that the heroine can even conceive of an act of rebellion. There is a passive acceptance of the status quo that is disturbingly reminiscent of Hitler's Germany. I am told that this question is somewhat addressed in volumes 2 & 3 of the trilogy, but by then it is too late, especially for those children who read only volume 1.

It is well past time, especially in light of the recent murder of 20 babies in Connecticut, to consider the impact on young people of such literature, along with comparable movies and video games.","What's that? Mr. Darcy doesn't want to dance at the dance?

Welcome to almost any 8th grade dance. You will find most of the boys playing basketball in the gym while the girls are waiting in the cafeteria for someone with whom to dance.

I was rooting for Mr. Bingley to get away. Maybe he just isn't that into Jane?

The scenes bounce from one scene to another so quickly that it makes my head spin, and I couldn't connect with any of the characters.

Elizabeth spends most of the novel, sitting around complaining about Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley while doing absolutely nothing to better her situation. At least Jay Gatsby did something about his love.....","To Kill a Mockingbird is the worst kind of book. It is a perfect example of a white-guilt fantasy. It attempts anti-racism and only accomplishes the opposite. No, I’m not talking about the heavy usage of the word “nigger.” Most people fail to understand the issue; I have even heard it implied that talking about race in such a manner is racist because we should be color-blind in a post-racist utopian world. No, I am talking about the plot and the characters themselves. Calpurnia perpetuates the inherently racist mammy archetype and is the only black in the book portrayed as intelligent. The rest are not only uneducated, but they are explicitly written to be stupid. Yes, the sole intelligent black is the one serving the white folk. This is what Harper Lee is trying to tell you. The good blacks are the subservient ones.
The book compares blacks to mockingbirds. They are portrayed are harmless animals that should be treated accordingly. Animals. Subhuman. You would not treat an animal needlessly cruelly, and therefore you should not do the same to blacks. This echoes the sentiment of many early abolitionist groups who still believed blacks to be inferior, but just thought they deserved more rights than objects and they still believed in segregation. That was just barely praiseworthy back then and it was an abhorrent belief by the time this book came out. The book removes the idea of black resistance and depicts the blacks as passive creatures who are simply waiting for the White Man’s rescue. Atticus Finch is a complete and blatant white-guilt self-insert. It simultaneously never dares to put blacks in an aggressive position for fear of coming off as “racist. Again, Harper Lee completely misses the point.

The worst part of all this is that most whites completely miss the point. They might publish an edition with the word “nigger” removed, thinking that the usage of the word in a novel shows inherent racism. Their nostalgia and racism blinds them from the fact that the book itself has racist messages at its core. It was written to make white people feel better about themselves, and is an anti-racism attempt as awkward as somebody saying “my favorite slaves are niggers.” It is demeaning to black students and it should not be taught in classrooms. The very fact that this book is touted as a literary masterpiece (mostly for the supposed anti-racism rather than any exceptional prose or complexity) is just another piece of evidence that racism is still alive and well.

Just to avoid any straw man arguments about me: I believe the works of Toni Morrison and Zora Neale Hurston to be worthless, not due to racism, but due to being poor literature. I am not very political. I don’t believe progressive social themes or anti-racism are pre-requisites for a great novel and I’m not a victim of white guilt. I’m just a reader who was disgusted by what I read and that alone gives me the right to speak on this novel and that alone is why I am speaking on it and that alone is what is relevant.

Oh yeah, and on the quality of the writing itself: all of the symbolism is contrived, the characterization is flat, and the prose fails to impress. It is simply not a very good piece of literature. You would do better to read something like Invisible Man, a book that was well-written in addition to containing impressively profound social and racial commentary.","Everyone in the whole world seems to adore this book and yet I hate it SO MUCH. The writing style is just SO grating; it took me forever to figure out why, but I think in large part it's because it's 100% telling-without-showing. See, the premise is awesome -- a book set in Germany during WWII, narrated by Death, focusing on the life of one civilian German girl. But Death(/the author) just tells you what everyone's feeling or doing, so the characters are like flat automatons. There's no depth or pathos, in what should be a really fascinating story. Further, the narrator doesn't so much foreshadow as tell you everything that's going to happen, eliminating any suspense. Plus the tone is just annoying; kind of condescending and precious.

And in lots of places the writing is just *bad* -- tons of passive voice (""two giant words were struggled with, carried on her shoulder, and dropped as a bungling pair at Ilsa Hermann's feet""), and it tries way too hard to be literary and deep and often just ends up being awkward and clunky.

It's a shame this falls so flat for me, when there's so much awesome YA Holocaust literature out there -- The Devil's Arithmetic, Number the Stars, The Diary of Anne Frank and more. Or if you want a book about bombing in Germany, read Slaughterhouse V.

I can't even finish it, and I ALWAYS finish books I'm more than halfway through; maybe I'll come back someday, but all my previous attempts have ended in gnashing of teeth. It leaves such a bad taste in my mouth.",,,"I didn't like this book at all. I finished it in 2 hours, actually reading the first few chapters and then skimming the rest. I couldn't make myself care for the characters. I find them all to be unbelievably irritating. I thought Hazel was condescending and a know-it-all. She talks like this: ""I need an ambulance. The great love of my life has a malfunctioning G-tube."" Like seriously? Who says that, let alone to a 911 operator?

The plot, meh, nothing I haven't read before. The dialogue, what teenagers speak like they did? Like can you use hamartia in a sentence? I mean why not just say tragic flaw?

And the cigarette metaphor? Just horrible.","For once, I'm going to follow one of my mother's favorite admonitions: if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.","The Confederate Heart


First, A Conversation Between Two Liberals:

“I’m reading ‘Gone with the Wind,’” I said to my friend Julie.
“Oh, you are reading that politically incorrect book that the liberals love to hate,”
“Yes. I want to see what it is all about since I don’t remember the movie outside of not liking Scarlett. And I found that I like Civil War novels. This one won a Pulitzer Prize as you know.”
“How much have you read? She asked.
“The war has just started, and so far, Scarlett isn’t too bad…”

The Hearts of the Southerners

If I recall correctly, the book begins with a lawn party at Scarlett’s parent’s Tara Planation near Atlanta, Georgia. Scarlett, age 16, is surrounded by boys who adore her, but she only has eyes for Ashley, who, has no interest in her or so it seems. And there is talk of a Civil War, but she doesn’t wish to hear about it.

I learn soon enough that she is self-centered, everything that conjures up the title of being a “narcissist.” Still, she is not too bad. Yet. In time, I will come to believe that she is also a sociopath.

Early on in the book, I get glimpses of racism, and this begins to affect me more than Scarlett’s narcissism. At least in the beginning. It is claimed that the slaves are happy working in the fields and in her home. They sing in the fields, but what the southerners don’t know, and what is not revealed in this book, is that their songs are mostly in code. They are letting each other know what is going on, even when plans for escape are about to occur. When and where.

As I read on, I learn that they call the slaves: Niggers and Darkies. Next, they are referring to them as apes and monkeys, dumb as children, lazy, etc. I am finding it hard to wish to finish the book due to this, but I will finish it, this I know. I just want this review done before I find myself with more anger than I feel at this moment.

So now Scarlett tells Ashley that she loves him, and he tells her that he is marrying Nellie. So, to spite him or for some other reason, she marries Nellie’s brother, Charles. Then the war begins, and Ashley and Charles go off to war. Scarlett finds that she is pregnant and moves to Charle’s parent’s home in Atlanta. Atlanta, a city she loves. Her hatefulness continues to fester for she has nothing good to think in her mindabout Nellie, who is also living there and is with child. Scarlett wishes Nellie dead, and when Scarlett has a baby, she about wishes the same for him. I won’t get into how she treats him.

Years go by, and the Yankees are about to take over Atlanta. My boredom with the book has ended for now it turns into an adventure, a survival story, the kind I like to read. But this doesn’t last for me. Rhett had been in Atlanta during this time, and Scarlett and he had many conversations that always infuriated her. She had met him at Tara, and he always exposed her for who she really was. I am thinking, but I am not sure, if this is the romance story that is supposed to be a GREAT LOVE STORY. If it is, I am missing something. If the love story is between Scarlett and Ashley, I am still missing something.

Anyway, when they see that the Yankees are about to enter Atlanta, it is said that this would end the war, that the Confederates had lost it. but the war went on for a while longer after the Yankees entered and destroyed Atlanta. People were leaving the city, and some were gathering the food at the food storage facilities so that the Yankees couldn’t have it.

Scarlett wanted to return to Tara and went to talk to Rhett about taking her there. And he did, but just so far, then he told her to go on by herself the rest of the way.

Tara was in ruins. All the food animals had been taken by the Yankees. Most of the 100 “happy” slaves that her father had owned, had left with the Yankees for the Yankees had “brainwashed them into believing that life on a plantation was horrible.”

But survive they do, but their easy way of life had ended. The southerners hate the Yankees for what they had done, and they have hated them ever since and hope that someday the South will rise again.

You can drive through a Georgia town, whose name I don’t recall, and the cemetery is on the main road. It is surrounded by confederate flags. Maybe it is a Confederate cemetery, but if not, those buried there are still Confederates in their hearts. And if you go into some of their homes, I imagine that you will see this book right next to their Bible.

Update: I have finished the book. What an accomplishment. To think I put off reading books that have a lot of pages like this one that had around 1000.

The author of other books, Pat Conroy, had written an introduction, and his mother had this book next to the Bible and read it to him often. He loves the book. What can I say? People love it for various reasons, and it isn’t always because they are racists. It is, in fact, a great story. Some people do n’t even know that it is racist. I know that I didn’t know what racism was when I first saw the movie when I was in my teens. I didn’t even know that my parents were racists.

At times, as when the Southern people were putting down the Blacks, even killing them, this book was hard to read, and sometimes, I heard my own parent’s words. Often, I felt that racism in today’s society is the same as it was then. Not much has changed, but then again, much has. I came away feeling that this is the racist’s Bible, and that they had the Bible to back them up.

And then Scarlett’s meanness grew worse and worse, and I could not stand how she was treating people, but at the end of the book, I felt sorry for her, for Rhett, and Nellie and Ashly, in spite of their racism. As for Scarlett, I felt bad for her more because she was miserable and could and would never change. She about destroyed the lives of those around her. If there are any redeeming qualities in this book, it can teach one how not to act.",,"i have always hated this book.

maybe it's because i hate being sad, and nothing on god's great green earth makes me sadder than lonely people. even if the story i'm reading is about people no longer being lonely, that requires reading about them starting out that way, doesn't it!

maybe it's that this book is a true who's who of every social issue, traumatic event, and general and various Bad Thing and Unpleasant Subject the author could think of, while just barely scraping over the 200 page mark.

maybe it's that i find books like this, which are seemingly very admirably intended to let teens know they aren't alone, more often lead to a romanticization of solitude and a detestation of happy people / mainstream people / popular people in our moldable youth that lasts a lifetime and creates some of the most miserably performative and performatively miserable human beings on the planet.

or maybe i'm just a hater.

let's call it all of the above and move on.","I quite enjoyed the first several chapter of this book. The chapters where she was at school were very thought-provoking and challenged the way I thought about things; both of which I love in a novel and why I read classics.

And then she got to Thornfeild where things quickly went downhill. I had to stop reading for over a year when I got to the part where Jane is comparing herself to Blanche Ingram: “Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence: to-morrow, place the glass before you, and draw in chalk your own picture, faithfully, without softening one defect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no displeasing irregularity; write under it, ‘Portrait of a Governess, disconnected, poor, and plain.’"" Gag me. It literally took me a year to get through this and the following two paragraphs. Whine whine whine. She sounds like a boy crazy twelve year old.

After that I couldn't really get back into the novel. I kept thinking how detrimental this novel must be to young readers: how it taught them to compare themselves to others in the eyes of a man, and how it's ok to be treated like a servant by the one you love. I became even more alarmed the further her relationship with Mr. Rochester developed. He is verbally and emotionally abusive. He is controlling and manipulative. His speech after their ruined wedding was painful for me to read: Everything he said could have been uttered by a psychological manipulator. The man clearly had a personality disorder of some sort. I read in dread of Jane's response.

AND THEN SHE LEFT! I was so excited. ""Ah! This is why this book is so beloved! She's true to herself leaves such an abusive relationship! Go Jane! Venture out on your own! Hooray!""

And then she found Sinjin Rivers and my horror grew. Talk about emotionally abusive! Talk about manipulative! THIS guy has serious control issues. He even goes so far as to use God to control others. He made me sick. But Jane turned him down too! Hooray! Go Jane! After that whenever Sinjin talked all I read was ""Whine Whine Whine, manipulate, manipulate manipulate."" I kept trying to tell Jane just to LEAVE! You can't have an actual conversation with crazy people! But she didn't. And then she did leave, and to my horror, went back to her previous abuser.

But at least now he's blind! And physically maimed! So that's the moral of the story? ""If you love someone who is an abuser just leave and hope that they are horribly burned in a fire and then the two of you can live happily ever after."" Young girls should seriously not read this. This is like Twilight: Where it just teaches young girls that true love is an abusive relationship. And then the young girls get into those relationships and we wonder why they don't just leave. It's because they've read books like this.

I get that Jane discovers who she truly is: She survives years of abuse from her childhood on up and learns that striking a balance between her morality and her emotions is the only way to be true to herself. I get Bronte is saying that only a person who is well developed, self confident and knows who they are can be in an actually happy relationship, and those are all good things. It just terrifies me that Bronte's version of a good man is an abusive one, and I fear that she has passed that flaw on to countless impressionable women.","Badly written and very sexist. Evil is synonymous with ugly and fat. Girls Percy doesn't like are all described as ugly and masculine (and it is made sure that the reader knows that masculine traits in a girl or a woman mean that she is evil).

And you would not think it possible to turn Greek mythology into conservative American nationalism, but Riordan managed even that.

If you are looking a book to buy for a teenager, do get them something else. Most bricks are better literature than this.",,"It has always fascinated me that no matter what book you read, movie you watch, game you play, etc. there are several million people who were affected by it in precisely the opposite way as you. If you hated it, many people loved it. If you loved it, many hated it.

This is one of the worst books I've ever read. The characters were unbelievable, their actions unrealistic. The writing was tedious and almost wholly lacking in excitement (not to mention paragraphs). It goes on, and on, and on, probably since Russian writers of this period like Dostoevsky were actually paid by the page, which of course would encourage you to write as much as you could, regardless of quality.

I read it on the strength of recommendations from people who loved it, and I stuck it out until the very end hoping that there might be something on the last page that redeemed it. There was not - when I finished this book I threw it across the room. I'll donate it to a charity shop though, because there's undoubtedly someone who will experience it in exactly the opposite way as me.","""I didn't know it at the time...""

Kill me.","Since discovering in my early teens how much better written narratives are than movies, I've always strived to read a book first before watching an upcoming film that's based on it. To that end, in August of last year, I downloaded Les Miserables to my Kindle, the forthcoming and much ballyhooed musical released in December providing necessary impetus to finally take the plunge into Victor Hugo's 'classic'. I thought giving myself roughly five months to read it before the movie's premier would prove adequate.

I was wrong.

I have yet to finish Les Miserables. According to my Kindle, I've progressed through 24% of it. It's not for lack of opportunity; I've probably read 6-8 other books in this timeframe, including some lengthy historical non-fiction. As painful as it is to admit, it's difficult to foresee myself finishing it. It's not to say I haven't enjoyed parts of it; in fact, I highlighted a couple of early passages I considered quite insightful. But I've also discovered a disturbing secret about Victor Hugo.

The dude just won't shut up.

I have not read many 'classics', but that's usually from lack of interest on the subject matter, not lack of effort on my part. The ones I have read I've finished, if not with enjoyment, then at least without trouble. Until now. A lover of books my whole life, I think I've finally discovered what people who aren't readers deal with all through high school: the stereotypically tedious, wordy and completely unfathomable classic novel.

If Hugo would stay on track with the main narrative, he could hold my interest. But he's not content to describe a building's shape, for instance, but must prattle on paragraph after paragraph about its resemblance to some ancient Roman construction, describe its location in such infinite detail only a contemporary or a French History major could appreciate, include a reference to Plato or some other philosopher, and finally extemporize on the building's impact on history and continued significance into the future. Time & time again, these exhausting tangents interrupt the actual story.

I maintained a flickering ember of interest up through Jean Valjean's encounter with Fantine, but after completely switching gears in Volume II, and plodding through descriptions of and dissertations on the battlefield of Waterloo that has SO FAR taken up I know not how many pages but according to my Kindle, THREE full percent of the entire novel, I ran out of gas. I'd lost all enjoyment in reading this book and just didn't care anymore.

So there it is. I can't say I'll never finish this book. I CAN say I've never dreaded the prospect of reading something more.",,,"OMG guys... really?
How is this so popular? I truly don't understand.

The classic YA that’s outdated.
The bony, oblivious, white Mary Sue that’s NEVER hungry. The huge melodrama coming when a character is gay. I mean like when people realize the character's sexuality, they feel differently and act differently towards them and stuff... I hated that. The overwhelming amount of hot men lusting after our very plain but for some reason, very special main character (I mean really, where are all these men in real life?? I’ll find myself lucky if I manage to find just ONE).
Pitiful love triangles.

Even more pitiful (and disturbing) excuses for characters not to be together.

The rat persecution... what even was that? How was that a plotline?

Cringy lines. Examples:

“You really wanna know what else my mom said about you?” She shook her head, he didn’t seem to notice. “She said you’d break my heart.” - ok... Not at all dramatic.

“Nobody had called her beautiful.” Really? Really?? So. Freaking. Annoying.

I think what bothered me the most is this book was SO poorly written. When a book has weak plotlines and cliche characters I might still enjoy it if it's well written, but this book just reads like a very bad first draft.
Even the “plot twists” and -good guys gone bad- are so predictable and boring. If I had to define this book in one word, the world would be BORING.
Please, guys, explain the appeal to me.
And tell me, how in the world am I going to read the next million books there are?
People keep telling me it gets better... I sure hope so.","The story itself: This could have really used a better editor. I didn't understand why the boyfriend character was even in there--he added nothing to the story. In addition, Skeeter keeps telling us that Hilly and Elizabeth are her friends but that's just it--she tells us. We never see why she would want to be friends with either of them, Hilly especially. Other characters were equally unbelievable. All the maids are good people and so gracious to Miss Skeeter, save one. Reading their interactions with Skeeter, I was reminded of Chris Rock's bit about old black men: ""I know some of you white people know an old black man--'Oh, Willy at the job--he's so nice!' Willy hates your guts."" Worst of all is the particular characterization of Aibileen. I was going to say that it borders on portraying her as a Magical Black Person because I didn't think she had magical powers, but then I remembered the part about how her fellow church members think her prayers are more powerful than others'.

The premise: Before reading, my question was, can Kathryn Stockett write this story? I read the whole book. I read the self-conscious afterword. Can Stockett write this story? Well, of course she can. But should she? I lean toward no. This is not her story to tell. I was reminded of Lo's Diary and how Pia Pera said that she thought of a part in Lolita as an invitation to a a literary tennis match and so she had to write it and no, you didn't. And neither did Kathryn Stockett. She said that she wrote this book because it'd never occurred to her what her maid Demetrie's life was like. So she made up the story. And it was still all about the white lady.","This novel was an absolute ordeal to get through. The beginning is compelling what with the vivid descriptions of Dracula castle and how Jonathan Harker reaches it. But what ensues will put you to sleep. Lucy's deterioating health is described in excruciating detail and the ominous count Dracula is intimidated and defeated amazingly easily for someone with such devestating supernatural powers. Also, he hardly appears in the novel. The whole story line basically just consists of convoluted journal entries. The fact that certain characters such as Mina and Renfield are able to read the count's mind just constitutes a deep-seeded flaw in Stoker's narrative style. In spite of the fact that this is billed as a horror novel it is completely devoid of thrills and tension. It frustrates me that novels of this quality are remembered and spawn infinite movie adaptations and spin-offs while the works of genuinely talented and original authors sink into oblivion.","No stars for you, homophobic douche.

In 2008, Card made a bunch of idiot statements about gay people. I disliked ENDER'S GAME when I read it many years ago; it's a tedious tale of strangely and negatively homoerotic/pedophilic prurience; but reading his work and insulting it became a mission in 2013. That was the Year of the Deletions, when Goodreads committed a horrendous breach of trust by simply deleting reviews flagged by a group of idiot users as ""not community friendly"" or some such crap.

Users affected by this weren't given notice of the company's intent to destroy their data. It simply...vanished. At that time, I was a significantly more well-read reviewer than I am now. I left Goodreads out of a sense of outraged solidarity with people who had no backups of the content they created, unpaid and out of love for books, that Goodreads then and now uses as value-added sales material. Not that long after Amazon took over Goodreads, it became obvious that ""negative"" reviews were in for a flagging and, if that wasn't enough, a trolling.

So many issues got rolled into the outrage and sense of violation that goes with some business entity acting ham-handedly that it became easier and better for my personal mental health (which would snap shortly anyway) to get out of here. I went from the Forbes 25...the 25 most influential reviewers on the site...to a group blog and a lonely little personal blog for new reviews. Naturally enough my supposed sway here diminished and then pretty much vanished as life's vicissitudes finally caught up with me and sent me to the psych ward for a good long stretch.

But before I vanished, I mocked the many 5-stars-or-else thugs who ran (possibly still run, I'm better at ignoring people these days) roughshod over the idea of respectful disagreement with the opinions of others by rating some of their darlings as above. It drove them nuts that I rated books like this one AND had read them, so was immune to accusations of partisanship.

Well, not immune, I was and am a partisan of political, social, economic, and moral Liberalism and liberalism. It shows. I'm happy with that.

So rather than review the books at the time I read them, I rated them and waited for the haters to hate. They didn't disappoint me. Three years on, I don't care about the anvil chorus of conform-or-suffer any more. So here it is: I didn't like this book by an author whose politics and personality I don't like.",
"When I turned the last page in this book I almost threw it across the room.
Until then I would have given The Hunger Games a four star rating: well-drawn, sympathetic characters, zippy plot, pathos; and what seemed to be a realistic story/page count proportion.
But then. ""End of Book One."" There was nothing on the book jacket to hip me to the series issue.
I have issues with series. That will have to wait for a non-review rant.","The most overated book in history of literature. The ""plot"" borders between meaningless and trivial.

I was forced to read the book in 9th grade English class. This was perhaps the most tedious school assignment I've received to date. For several pages a lady remarks to a man about what wonderful handwriting he has. Not exactly gripping material. The entire book seemed to be about hormone-driven marriageable-age creatures trying to outwit each other in word and on the dance floor.

The book itself is bad enough, but to complicate matters, women pledge allegiance not only to the book but also to the gazillion-hour movie.","I'm still so surprised, though I shouldn't be. This book, which has been praised and recommended to me by so many fellow whites, is racist as hell. And no, I don't mean ""racist"" like ""gasp it talks about racism and used the n-word and made me uncomfortable,"" I mean it is a white savior story that depicts black people as passive, incompetent, and one-dimensional. Cal is blatantly a mammy. In one monologue, Atticus describes racism as a white man ""taking advantage of a Negro's ignorance."" The Finch family behave in extremely entitled ways for the sake of educating the kids. Atticus mostly explains racism in vague terms (in summary, people hate each other) that don't challenge white supremacy, and then he vehemently defends terrible white people in his community and contradicts his anti-racism for the sake of what, being nice to everyone? Atticus says it's not okay to hate Hitler or to judge people who want to lynch black men because judging people is bad. This isn't progressive or revolutionary even for the time period if you know anything about black resistance in history. Positive reviews even explicitly say Tom is just a ""tool"" for teaching Scout to not be prejudiced. ""Mockingbirds don’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird."" GROAN. Regardless of the fact that Atticus wasn't actually able to live out his white savior dreams, the book's focus is on good white people and how hard they have it, and I just don't find that a useful way to learn about this history or derive some moral lesson.

Before anyone says, ""You missed the point"": I know what the alleged point is (after reading TKAM, I read some analysis to be sure). I think it's a shitty point. This book is too basic to be assigned over black authors writing on the same topic with better and more revolutionary approaches. Much like The Help, I'm glad I didn't read this in high school because I would have eaten it right up.","I give up, I wave the white flag of surrender. I’m over half way through this book and I can’t force myself to continue. I’m bored stupid. The more I read, the more I hate, and I see no reason to give myself an aneurysm over this idiotic book. There are many mysteries in life and one of them is why people like the books they do. Why I dislike this book, however, is no mystery.

Markus Zusak’s The Book Thief is the (too goddamn lengthy) story of Leisel Meminger’s life in a small German town in the early 1940s, just before the beginning of World War Two. She is living with her foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann. Eventually, after pages and pages of descriptions of fat clouds and oatmeal skies and slumping leaves, a Jew comes to live with them. He is hidden in the basement. Because Leisel hugs him, he writes and illustrates a fascinating book for her called “The Standover Man.” Not only does Leisel get to read this literary masterpiece, but so does the reader as it is included in this book, bird/man drawings and all. That’s all I know. I mean, I know that the town gets bombed because Death is a chatty fellow and has alluded to it. Plus, I read a goodreads review that spilled the beans but I don’t care. These people are so damn incredibly boring and quite frankly I don’t care what happens to them.

This story moves at glacier pace. Not the global-warming-melting-of-Antarctic-glaciers that we have now, but the two inches a century pace to create mountains and lakes that we had a millennia ago. I don’t think there is a plot to this book. It’s basically the day-to-day (and sometimes minute-to-minute) actions of this small family living under Hitler’s regime. It’s the story of how they survive and their small rebellions against Hitler. Okay, great. If this book were written by someone else, I’d probably enjoy it. I like Hans and Rosa Hubermann. Zusak has managed to give them both just enough of a personality to see that I wish the book had been written from either of their perspectives because they are the only damn semi-interesting people in the book. Well, there’s Rudy the Jesse Owens wannabe. He at least is animated, unlike Liesel, the book thief. She’s just kind of there; her personality is as unsubstantial and thin as a ghost. So, she loves books. So do I, but that doesn’t make me love her. I think she’s creepy and weird. And why is she a book thief? Despite the book title, she hasn’t stolen one damn book yet. Even when she is surrounded by books in the mayor’s house, she isn’t tempted. What kind of thief is she? She steals apples. The priests’ food. But not one book. Maybe the book should be titled: The Food Thief. Maybe she’ll “steal” a book after the town’s been bombed. This is what she is does; she scavenges, not steals.

Death as the narrator is a great idea in theory, but annoying in practice. Death, as personified in this novel, talks too damn much and interrupts the flow of the story (slow as it is) with ridiculous bold-faced bulletins to tell us something either a) completely unnecessary or b) incredibly obvious. Examples of a) can be found on pages 213 and 241. Examples of b) can be found on pages 211 and 215. Obviously, there are many examples, but 215 is hilarious. I want to look at Death and say, “Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.” Here is the paragraph before the Bulletin of Obvious Shit: “Christmas came and went with the smell of extra danger. As expected, Hans Junior did not come home (both a blessing and an ominous disappointment), but Trudy arrived as usual, and fortunately, things went smoothly.” Here’s the bold-faced bulletin which follows immediately after that (off-set by asterisks so the idiotic reader doesn’t skip it):
THE QUALITIES OF SMOOTHNESS*******Max remained in the basement. Trudy came and went without any suspicion.
Thanks for that, Death. I’m so fucking stupid I may have missed that subtlety.

I absolutely hate the writing style. Hate . It’s so annoying. He often ends scenes with dramatic, short, choppy three or four word sentences. That fucking makes me crazy. He also anthropomorphizes everything. It’s compulsive. The infamous fat clouds: “Oh, how the clouds stumbled in and assembled stupidly in the sky. Great obese clouds. Dark and plump. Bumping into each other. Apologizing. Moving on and finding room” (79). The pile of discarded items to create a bonfire: “It reminded her of an unpopular child, forlorn and bewildered, powerless to alter its fate. No one liked it. Head down. Hands in pockets. Forever. Amen” (109). A secret: “As the book quivered in her lap, the secret sat in her mouth. It made itself comfortable. It crossed its legs” (246). If I have a rage-induced fit while writing this book review, it’s because I fucking hate the way this man writes. It’s so incredibly irritating. I’m tempted to take a red pen to almost every sentence because the examples above are true to the whole style of the book. Another Goodreads reviewer called it bad juvenile poetry disguised as prose. That’s exactly what it is. Some of it doesn’t even make any damn sense: “Initially, he tried to resist, but it was harder every day that the girl appeared, each time with a new weather report, either of pure blue sky, cardboard clouds, or a sun that had broken through like God sitting down after he’d eaten too much for his dinner” (250). It’s that last phrase (“or a sun that had broken through”) that makes my brain hurt. What the fuck? What the hell does that mean? Why the hell do I even try to get meaning out of the fuzzy word-vomit Zusak spews onto the page? I’ll spare you a direct quote of Liesel’s charming descriptions of the weather (the cloud is a rope and the sun is a yellow hole tied to the end of the rope) but the prose isn’t there to tell a story. It’s there to distract the reader from the realization that this story is going nowhere very slowly. If you don’t know good writing, then you’ll think Zusak is brilliant. Granted, the idea of “good” writing is subjective to a point, but I think writing has to meet a certain amount of criteria to be considered “good” or “bad”. This is not good. It needs the help of a heartless editor with an endless supply of red ink.

The sappy quality. Spare me from novels written for the sole purpose of making the readers sniffle back their tears. I’m not hard-hearted, but I’m also not easily manipulated. The writer has to work for it. I’m not going to shed a tear over Liesel or Rudy or the Hubermanns. They aren’t real people for me. Is the general setting of the novel tragic (Hitler Germany)? Yes. But so what? If I want to be sad about that, I’ll read a non-fiction book or a better-written novel on the same subject. I despise the way Zusak manipulates the reader’s emotions. For example (this is another one of those damn Death bulletins):
A GUIDED TOUR OF SUFFERING
To your left, perhaps your right, perhaps even straight ahead, you find a small black room. In it sits a Jew. He is scum. He is starving. He is afraid. Please—try not to look away. (138)
Oh, fuck you. Can you be any more manipulative? And try this:
“On many counts, taking a boy like Rudy was robbery—so much life, so much to live for—yet somehow, I’m certain he would have loved to see the frightening rubble and the swelling of the sky on the night he passed away. He’d have cried and turned and smiled if only he could have seen the book thief on her hands and knees, next to his decimated body. He’d have been glad to witness her kissing his dusty, bomb-hit lips.
Yes, I know it.
In the darkness of my dark-beating heart, I know. He’d have loved it, all right.
You see?
Even death has a heart” (242).
Christ. That’s maudlin and awful and very grief-porny. Give me a fucking break.

While writing this review, I’ve realized how much I dislike this book. Not just the writing style (which I hate) but the overall book. It’s not a John Green TFIOS level of hate, but a very strong dislike. It’s terrible, just as much of YA fiction seems to be. It’s awful in a different way (no vampires or shape-shifters or silly romance), but still awful. I’m so glad I’m not a teenager being raised on this godawful fucking horrible young adult fiction. If kids are raised to think this is good writing, what hope do we have for the future? Publishing (in America at any rate) is losing respectability. You could argue (with books like 50 Shades of Grey) it already has. It seems to me that many of the books today are written and published solely to make money. There is no artistic sensibility to it anymore, particularly the young adult genre. The age group on the receiving end of the marketing of these books is more likely to obsess over favored novels, go see movies based on those novels, and buy novel-centered merchandise (Hunger Games, anyone?) Better-written (adult) literary fiction is not likely to make authors and (more importantly) publishers lots of cash. So while that’s all great (gotta keep the economy moving), these kids grow up not knowing what the hell a well-written book is, particularly if this crap (and John Green’s shit pile) is required reading school. Maybe their tastes will evolve. Maybe they have parents/extended family/good friends who will expose them to prose that requires them to think because not every motive or emotion is spoon-fed to the reader. Not every YA novel I’ve read is utter crap, but so many are that I am gloomy about the future of publishing and reading. Am I being too pessimistic? I don’t know. But for now I’m going to drown my sorrows in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s most excellent Sherlock Holmes stories.",,,"There are two compliments I can give The Fault in Our Stars: 1) it didn’t suck nearly as much as Paper Towns (but almost) and 2) Hazel compares her air pump to a pet dragon sleeping with her on page 120. While I think the description is badly worded, I like the image it brings to my mind. I don’t understand what all the kerfuffle is over John Green. He’s mediocre at best and insulting to teenagers at his worst. If I were a cancer patient, or had a loved one suffering from cancer, this book would really piss me off. It still pisses me off, but from a more removed, “reader insulted by Green’s bullshit” point of view. He created this cancer story for the purpose of mocking cancer survivor-type stories (for their sentimentality? Their optimistic, “look on the bright side” message?), but he falls into his own trap by writing a book that presents characters who are defined only by their cancer. This book takes the easy way out and is melodramatic and manipulative and a waste of time.

Hazel has terminal cancer and her lungs don’t work as well as they used to so she drags around an oxygen tank with her. At the insistence of her parents, she attends a weekly support group. At this support group, she meets Augustus (Gus). He lost most of a leg due to cancer. Not surprisingly, he is hot. Not surprisingly, he finds Hazel hot too (he likens her to Natalie Portman circa V for Vendetta) and they begin to hang out. Also not surprisingly, they fall in love because what’s more romantic than two young lovers stricken with cancer? Hazel shares her love for a ridiculous book called An Imperial Infliction with Gus, a book she has read and re-read many times. Guess what? It’s about a girl with cancer. Gus is also taken with the book and together they try to reach the author, Peter Van Houten, who lives in the Netherlands. This book ends midsentence with no convenient ending to wrap up the characters’ lives. Hazel finds this so disagreeable that when they do manage to make it to the Netherlands to visit the author (this trip materializes magically with the help of the Genies. Your dying cancer wish is their command!), Hazel demands an ending to the book. She is surprised when the author is less than pleasant and irritated by her rudeness. The book ends as it should by manipulating some of its readers into thinking it’s the best book ever written and creating for these same readers copious amounts of tears. I, the hard-hearted person that I am, rolled my eyes and muttered several profanities.

The characters in this book never make a deep impression on me because they aren’t real people. The author tells me they feel sad or angry but as they are cardboard people with no complexity, I don’t sense that they feel anything too deeply. Due to Green’s hyperactive and ludicrous dialogue, they all talk alike. Gus says, “I’m awash in the metaphorical resonance of the empty playground in the hospital courtyard” (173) and “the incessant mechanized haranguing of intensive care” (312—can’t you see Green smugly congratulating himself on that masterpiece? I can). Isaac: “that kid never took a piss without pondering the abundant metaphysical resonances of human waste production” (258). Finally, Hazel: “We live in a universe devoted to the creation, and eradication, of awareness…He died after a lengthy battle with human consciousness, a victim—as you will be—of the universe’s need to make and unmake all that is possible” (266). I will allow that these kids are very smart (Green very much wants readers to know that the kids are light years smarter than the adults; there’s a scene in which Hazel is explaining her metaphorical pipe t-shirt to her mother and mom basically says, “Wow. Yer so smart. I’m jus the dummy mummy. You go talk smart stuff with Gus and I’ll go drool on myself.” WTF.) but why are they so pretentious? They sound as if they sit around with a dictionary and thesaurus crafting clever sentences to use later. Oh, wait, that’s the author.","I’m so disappointed I think I might cry!!
This book was supposed to be great, it’s a classic!!... but for me it was one of the worst books I have ever read. I hated it!, at the end I skimmed over the last 5 chapters ‘cause I just couldn’t bear it any more…

Oscar Wilde explains everything to the minimal detail… the beauty of the flowers, their perfume, the air, the sun, the birds, the trees… jeezzz!!
The book was slooooow… I used to think Dorian Gray was this smart handsome man but I found out he was a brainless guy who was easily manipulated, he didn’t have a thought of his own at all!
There were so many gaps in the story and then Lord Henry… oh my, every single word he said was so stupid it was just BORING!

I tried classics but they are for people way smarter than me, I like BDB, psy-changeling, dark-hunter and other series alike and I’m damn proud of it!!
I might try something else from my classic bookshelf buy it won’t be anytime soon… this book gave me a headache.","How to review this behemoth, almost a thousand pages, not to mention the film. It is much beloved still by many readers. There are so many areas of contention and discussion it is difficult to know where to start. Mitchell hangs the whole tale, covering about twelve years, on the character of Scarlett O’Hara. One review, from the Guardian, summed her up:
""The story exalts an incredibly spoiled, vain, hypocritical, dishonourable and narcissistic woman.""
If it had just been the convoluted love story involving Scarlett O’Hara, Rhett Butler, Ashley Wilkes and Melanie Hamilton then I am sure it would be much less well known. The setting is the key, starting in the ante-bellum South and encompassing the Civil War and its aftermath, including the rise of the Ku Klux Klan.
So, what are the issues? Obviously race and slavery are central and dominate the book and are linked to the rights and wrongs of the Civil War. Linked to this is the mythology around the South/the Confederacy. It is the referred to as The Cause, sometimes the Glorious Cause or the Lost Cause and conveys a pre-Civil War, abolition of slavery idyll. I will come back to this.
Mitchell herself was born in 1900. She obviously met many veterans and heard their stories:
“On Sunday afternoons when we went calling on the older generation of relatives, those who had been active in the Sixties, I sat on the bony knees of veterans and the fat slippery laps of great aunts and heard them talk.”
Her father was an amateur historian and collected information. Mitchell herself started to collect and write down reminiscences and recollections and she used many for the novel.
The obvious question is whether the book is racist. There shouldn’t be any real debate about that, of course it is. The novel strongly promulgates the myth that pre-war the slaves were happy, well looked after and were not desirous of freedom. The language used would in no way be acceptable today and even had to be toned down for the film. It also pushes the idea that after slavery came to an end the former slaves were lost, easily led (especially by Northern scallawags, carpetbaggers and ruffians) and effectively conned. Passages such as this illustrate the point:
“Aided by the unscrupulous adventurers who operated the Freedmen's Bureau and urged on by a fervor of Northern hatred almost religious in its fanaticism, the former field hands found themselves suddenly elevated to the seats of the mighty. There they conducted themselves as creatures of small intelligence might naturally be expected to do. Like monkeys or small children turned loose among treasured objects whose value is beyond their comprehension, they ran wild - either from perverse pleasure in destruction or simply because of their ignorance.”
This is not a character speaking, but an authorial point of view talking about the “horrors” of Reconstruction. There is a great deal more like this.
As well as the racism there is the abiding myth of the Old South. It portrays a happy society with contented slaves and where the poor white trash knew their place. A land flowing with milk and honey where women had their beaux and all was right with the world. It is a myth of course and most countries have similar myths. In the UK there was an abiding myth about idyllic pre Norman Conquest times which talked about the Norman Yoke. This developed into an abiding myth about pre-industrial times. These myths always omit the poor, starving and oppressed and this one is no different. An idyllic past which did not exist.
There are certainly strong female characters in the novel, but then marital rape is ok as well (towards then end, how does Scarlett realise she really loves Rhett?).
It certainly tells a tale which can hold the reader, but so many values I hold dear would have to be suspended to enjoy this and I couldn’t do it.",,"Bloody awful.

Imagine this: The Catcher In The Rye was fucked rough by A Million Little Pieces. The zygote's DNA was re-spliced with 1980's panic journalism and bombarded with x-rays for six months. It was then delivered premature on a bloody altar beneath a full moon and methodically, repeatedly dropped on its head by Chuck Palahniuk.

Any plot whose central premise is an amnesia of the daytime TV variety belongs in a very special category. For me that category is ""books to be burned with their authors atop the pyre.""","I finally finished it with Nadia May narrating.

Just... Really, what are the chances that she ends up at the cousins' house to begin with?

The whole thing could have been a 20 page short story about the lady in the attic and I'd be so much happier","Who knew the category of young adult books aimed at boys was such a wasteland? I've been disappointed by Eoin Colfer and now this supposedly award-winning series by Rick Riordan.
The premise is clever but as many other readers have noted, it is pretty much a Harry Potter rip-off. In one scene, Percy (the hero) sees a guard reading a thick book with a wizard on the cover which he thinks must be good because the guard takes a while to respond. Percy himself, we are told, doesn't care for fantasy. Well, he might plead ignorance of JK Rowling but you can be sure the author has patterned his entire series on the boy-wizard books. Whereas Rowling offered young boys and girls the best of fiction and literature, Riordan and Colfer dish up tired, cliched action-packed adventures. The narrator mustn't pause in the action for a second to talk or think too long before plunging his sword into the next monster. Also, Rowling obviously did a lot of research on her subject and it is clear Riordan didn't when we find lazy errors sprinkled throughout the narrative (e.g. he mistakenly calls Nemesis a god instead of a goddess).
Aside from the bad writing, I struggled with the political ideology of this book. Let's leave aside the fact that there are no characters of color. I just finished reading a novel by a real Greek author called Middlesex and it is an interesting comparison between the candid, all-inclusive, racially and sexually diverse elements in that story versus the narrow world of Percy Jackson and the Olympians. But I think the big glaring problem no one has mentioned is that Riordan has some serious issues with women. Practically every woman character is evil. The only two good women are self-sacrificing defenders of the old patriarchic order. Violence against women is not simply tolerated--it is encouraged. Considering this is a postmodern twist on the old myths (incredibly rich, layered myths to which Riordan does an extreme disservice), the reader might expect that we hear about Medusa from a sympathetic perspective or about the Furies' version of their role as defenders of mother-right.
I feel sad for the young boys out there who are making do with this kind of book and its ilk. No wonder they'd rather play video games than read books. With cheap stories like this, it amounts to the same thing. They deserve better.",,"I couldn't do it. I couldn't finish it. I read 75% of the novel before giving up.

There is absolutely no plot to this book, no moral lessons, nothing except people talking in parlors and fainting into a delirium. To everyone who says, ""Maybe the book is better in Russian,"" I can reassure you that it's not.

Here is literally what happens during the entire book:

+Raskolnikov, a poor student, is on his couch
+ Then some people come visit him and talk about nothing
+ Then he's delirious on his couch again
+ Then he does a crime
+ Then he's back on the ole couch, delirious
+ He is a dick to basically everyone in his life, including his mom,
+ Some asides about poverty and propriety
+ Basically the entire plot of this novel could be resolved if he got his ass off the couch, went back to school, and GOT A JOB, HELPED HIS MOM AND SISTER, AND SHUT UP.

I was so bored/revulsed the whole time (and not in a good way, the way you cheer for an anti-hero, just genuinely nothing happens in this book) that I thought something was wrong with the fact that I didn't enjoy this classic that thousands of people have loved.","Totally derivative. Read the original from Inoué (Mémoires d'une geisha and not this orientalist trash. It is as if Dan Brown or, worse, EL James was writing about Japan. Zero character depth, gross stereotypes and just complete garbage. This is just Golden exploiting a voyeuristic fantasy and nothing more.","Longer review: The name says it all folks, there's not a lot of joy to be had for the characters in this book. I read it because I saw the musical for the first time a few years ago and loved it. I was SUPER surprised how different this was! There was almost no politics at all in this book. Also, Javert seemed insane and very strange.

But the biggest problem was Jean Valjean. I understand that he was trying to live a virtuous life but he kept needlessly shooting himself in the foot and he was completely inconsistent. If it is bad to let another person be punished for your crime, isn't it also bad to escape from the police? He drew the line in arbitrary, frustrating ways. He had a martyr complex that made the book quite unenjoyable.

And why not tell Marius that you rescued him? That wouldn't have been a bad thing at all! It only made things needlessly confusing.

I've seen others criticize Hugo's writing style and I'll just go ahead and agree with them. Twelve paragraphs when twelve words would have sufficed. Yet for all these words, the characters are almost complete mysteries.

I could go on and on but what is the point. It's a classic, nothing I say is going to change that. But if you haven't read it yet,trust me folks, stick to the musical.",,,"Ugh. This was a horrible book, I haven't disliked something this much in a long time. I'm giving it two stars because I was at least compelled enough to read the whole thing.

First of all...the writing. There were WAY too many awful similes that had me rolling my eyes and snorting with distaste. I don't really care that much about writing styles...so for me to say the writing was bad really is saying something. I felt like she was making the characters do things to fit into the story, and that has always bugged me. I think the story should fit the characters...you shouldn't have to make them do things that seem unnatural.

The plot, somewhat interesting...but not carried out well at all. About halfway through I realized it really wasn't going to get better and thought ""oh well, at least things with Jace and Clary are somewhat interesting."" Then (major spoiler ahead, so don't read on if you plan on picking this up)...they turn out to be brother/sister?? What the heck, they had kissed and had wonderful chemistry and they are SIBLINGS? Their relationship was about the only thing interesting or captured well in the story...and even that was ruined.

I really had high hopes for this too. Bummer.","how do you even discuss the damage this book, completely well-intentioned as it seems to be, has done?

i guess i can start this way:
the year i turned 12, this book was The Book. sold bajillions of copies, topped best-of lists by critics and media and readers, sold its movie rights. because i was a 10 year old who read everything, and because this book sounded hard but important, i got it for christmas.

i read it for the first time that day and cried my eyes out at the ending. i read it a million times more after that, not putting it down for what would ultimately be the last time until i was well into teenagedom. i didn't always answer the question ""what's your favorite book?"" with this, but i sometimes did.

in other words, because i had just turned 12 and because i lived in a mostly white area and and because my library selection was well-meaning but white and because i went to a public school where we didn't learn about slavery or jim crow or reconstruction until middle school, and we didn't REALLY learn about it ever, this book, by a white woman, was one of my first encounters with the concept of race.

this book, which is about a white woman being better equipped than black women to tell their story twice over, both on-page and off.

this book, which serves as an instruction manual for white women on how to use their tears. (an unnecessary one, since we've always been fairly good at that, but one all the same.)

this book, of white saviordom and of black women as background and as supporting characters to white protagonists and as both nannies and mothers but only one role matters to the story.

this book, in which black women speak in dialect and white women (even the ""white trash"" ones) speak in unaccented grammatically perfect english.

this book, which begins and ends in the 1960s and yet is feel-good above all, attempting a ""we're all people!"" happy tone that ignores privilege and racism and what is to come in order to try on the kind of color-blind belief system that eases the existences of white people everywhere.

this book, an account of black women losing their jobs and livelihoods and white women becoming what they always dreamed of being.

how to begin to undo the impact this story had on my brain?","Great beginning, but shortly after events switch to London the writing descends into tedious and poorly written melodrama and just plain bad dialogue (especially Van Helsing's). The Virtue of Manliness! The horror of female carnality! The constant weeping! The expressive nostrils! The latter half of the book is like one long cornpone homily intermixed with, dear my friends, an absurd amount of regurgitation, the manly weeping, and the nostrils of deep feeling. Terrible.",,
"This book was a huge disappointment to me , never expected it to be that bad .
a Story about 24 kids under 18 fighting and killing each other because of an evil government( capitol ) or whatever , Collins Never Explained Why , there's no one real reason why they should kill each other .
the worst thing about this book that it's just a copy from many books especially battle royal , also a bit from Harry potter and Twilight .
every line in the book reminds of an other book , seriously it's seems like Suzanne Collins bought bunch of books and she Started to copy them , she added few Pathetic quotes , finally she called it "" the hunger games "" to get people's attention , this book is unoriginal .
By the Way , Collins was hungry when she wrote this book , peeta means "" pita "" in french *remember peeta is a baker* , Gale means meat ( type of meat ) in Iraq .. what a coincidence !!!
i give this book : 1 out of 5 because the plot was predictable , no happy surprises , the characters have the depth of a white crayon ( especially in MockingJay ), so much violence and subliminal messages , the story is not original .
half star for the cover , half star for the quality .
agree or disagree ? i don't care .","This book has been billed as one of the greatest love stories in all of literature. I have no idea why. When the story begins, Elizabeth Bennett is smart, independent, and not overly concerned with bagging a husband, which, by the standards of Victorian England, makes her a feminist trailblazer. Then she meets Mr. Darcy, who acts like an insufferable prick (this in a society obsessed with grace and good manners), and Elizabeth has the good sense to identify Mr. Darcy as the insufferable prick he is. And so she spends the first part of the book rightly loathing this asshole. Fast forward: by chance, Elizabeth finds herself touring Darcy's palatial estate, meeting his hundreds of servants, using his solid gold bidet, and suddenly she starts thinking that maybe Mr. Darcy isn't such an asshole after all. The moral of the story seems to be that enough money can make even the most abrasive and obnoxious jerk seem like prince charming. And what's really frustrating is when you realize that it's 200 years later, and while the world has changed immensely, the people are still the same. Go society! So if you want to read a real love story, read Anna Karenina. If you want to read the biggest piece of anti-feminist drivel in the literary canon, then by all means, read Pride and Prejudice.","Really disliked this and even switching to the audiobook didn't make it more palatable: hated the 'white saviour' racial politics while all the Black characters are marginalised, passive and essentially characterless - hated the way Atticus makes preachy statements about walking in another's shoes without ever doing that himself - hated the way vile and bigoted opinions are forgiven because e.g. someone is in physical pain or we're told they're nice people really - hated the slowness and the way we spend forever watching a rabid dog getting shot just so that Atticus can pronounce one of his condescending axioms - hated the naive but comforting pat-ourselves-on-the-back scenes where we're told the KKK can be made ashamed of themselves by an irate shopkeeper and how Atticus announces that they're gone now and will never come back - found this as sentimental and schmaltzy as The Kite Runner - struggled to get to 50% for a group read - giving up now and can't even waste any more words on it!","This is one of the rare examples of a universal favourite which I disliked. I liked the premise: the little girl scraping together a meagre existence in war-torn Nazi Germany, stealing books on a regular basis to assuage her intellectual hunger - and the story narrated by none other than death himself. However, I found the narrative surprisingly flat and without any real power. It was very readable, but that was it.

I liked the movie, however.",,,"The Fault in Our Stars isn’t about cancer. (Cancer is so bubblegum and watered down in this book it takes backburner to nearly everything else.) The Fault in Our Stars is about John Green. It’s about John Green’s adoration for the generation that made him famous. It’s about John Green rehashing tired philosophy from the existentialists to make himself appear intellectual to his child-dominated audience.

The structure of the book is the same as Dog Soldiers by Robert Stone, as it is less of a story and more of characters waiting for a story. The opening (the Literal Heart of Jesus) is the same set-up as Fight Club, with the group counseling, a guy who has his balls cut out, and a character meeting an eccentric character that changes their life.

As other reviews have expressed, every character in this novel is John Green. Hazel is John Green’s consciousness. Augustus (who’s name is “cleverly” taken from Augustus Caesar) is John Green’s pseudo-intellectual mouthpiece. All of the parents are John Green’s ideal version of his own parenting style. Most of the plot involves Hazel obsessing over an author who has written book about cancer and ended it on an ambiguous note . . . like John Green.

While John Green is 36 at the time of this writing, the blatant millennial narcissism of his teenage audience is always present in his writing. He indirectly writes about himself, and it seems he knows little else to write about. He references Fitzgerald and Vonnegut as if he is on their literary level. This narcissism is not in any way earned. He hasn’t created a body of work sufficient to the authors he compares himself to. I could leave this paragraph with this idea, but I want to address the issue further. Narcissism, while naturally abhorrent, can be overlooked when the author is offering something of substance or genius. What is John Green offering? Childish paraphrases of philosophy books that are nearly a century old or older. For example, several times in the book it is marveled at the depth of a character putting a cigarette in his mouth but refusing to light it. It shows the cigarette industry doesn’t have power over his decisions. John Green treats this immature concept as if it is a brilliant philosophical revelation. But if we look at the action closer, it doesn’t make any philosophical sense. To any mature adult, the cigarette isn’t their rival; if you choose not to smoke, you choose not to smoke and life continues. There are bigger issues than if someone chooses to smoke. People who don’t smoke (in life, not in fiction) do not have reason to publically display apologetic behavior. Augustus has no reason to make the cigarette industry his philosophical rival; he does so because John Green finds the action quirky. As countless YA novels have proven, quirky sells to the teenage demographic. (This is why Augustus also has a “goofy” smile.) The philosophy in The Fault in Our Stars isn’t philosophy at deeper examination, it’s just marketing.

Both the characters and the plot are shallow. Hazel, who we are thought to relate to, describes herself early on in the book as having no interests in anything besides America’s Next Top Model. She is asked to describe herself, and she is incompetent to even think of one adjective. She, however, refers to herself countless times in the novel as “awesome” or “great” . . . for a reason she can’t even figure out. I understand this is relatable to today’s myopic female demographic, who has little personality and few interests. I could accept this character on terms of realism, but, let’s face it: characterless female protagonists make for no more interesting reading than their real life counterparts make for good spouses. Then John Green introduces Augustus, who is a stand-in for the “perfect guy”, in that he gives the female protagonist something to live for, because it is implied she had nothing before him, except her favorite book. (As most teenage girls reading this kind of book wish Augustus would come and give them something to live for.) He pursues her for little to no reason (other than she looks like Natalie Portman, I guess). This isn’t atypical of today’s real teenage male trying to affirm his decision to chase a girl he knows is uninteresting and unintelligent. There is a scene where, in true to life fashion, Augustus tries to pry any sort of commendable personality traits out of Hazel. (After his failure to find anything interesting, he ends up commenting that she doesn’t write poetry.) What is unrealistic, however, is that a teenage male would fall “in love” (as loose as the term can be used) and take the ridiculous lengths that Augustus does for such a girl. This seems more wish fulfillment for the female demographic than a plausible plot. By the point this wish fulfillment reaches its climax, John Green is so out of the spectrum of realism that he has his characters making out in the Anne Frank House while people clap around them. Soon after they have sex and Hazel is described as sensually feeling Augustus’s “stub [leg]”. I can’t, as most readers have, ignore this absurd plotting and poor writing.

But who is asking for realism? Apparently none of John Green’s fanbase. After the starting point of the two characters meeting, the novel turns into something of a fantasy. This is the most unrealistic portrayal of the thought process teenagers with cancer I’ve ever read. To put it simply, it’s laughable. The only attempts Hazel, Augustus, and the secondary characters make to deal with their own impending deaths seem to be angst and sarcasm. There is no psychological difference between these teenagers and normal teenagers. They constantly spout the existential “depth” John Green ham-fistedly forces into their dialogue, but none of them attempt to understand the actual depth of accepting their own deaths. I put that in italics because it seems readers of this book don’t understand the full extent of what these characters are ignoring. I do not buy for a moment that this is how teenagers react to a medical death sentence. They scoff at counseling (which is realistic), but their own scoffs seem to be the end of their thought process on the subject of their own deaths (which isn’t realistic in the slightest).

I think it is now time to write about my own experiences with the subject matter. I was diagnosed with cancer when I was 16, and pronounced in full remission when I was 21. I’ve been through months of chemotherapy. I’ve sat in children’s cancer wards for most of my teenage life. I’ve waited for PET scans to pronounce if, to put it bluntly, I was going to have a life. I don’t think this is the place for me to go into my thoughts during this time. I will say, from my own experience and the experience of the teenagers I’ve met with cancer, they understand death and do not react to it with sarcasm or petty philosophy. They don’t quote Sartre. They’re afraid. They’re upset and exhausted. They don’t act as if everything is fine and lead a normal (if angsty) life as the teenagers in this novel do. They don’t have the power to stop their treatments at will, as is a point in the novel. They lose their hair, puke constantly, take shots several times daily in their legs, physically smell like medication, and only have the energy for social interaction perhaps once a week—if it’s a good week. I don’t recall even any characters in this book having difficulty or pain from the port in their chest. None ever complain about the taste of saline that never leaves your mouth. It is to the novel’s fault that John Green “ignore[s] with a grin” (to quote him) the facts of cancer.

If John Green learned to focus on social realism (as he thinks he does), he would have an interesting stance on story structure. If he would replace the angst and childish musings in his writing with developed prose, he would be decent at technical writing. Every problem this novel (and its subsequent generation) has is one with inability to grow up. It is entirely possible that John Green could be a decent writer if he were to mature.","Cleanliness: I did not finish the book. The opening scene is of an artist and his friend admiring the artist’s recent painting of a young man. When his friend tells him he should exhibit it at the Grosvenor, the artist replies that he cannot. “I have put too much of myself into it.” This, I believe, sums up the book perfectly; but unlike the artist in the story, Oscar Wilde chose to put forth his art, and therefore himself, before the public’s eye.

The public did not like what they saw, despite the fact that the editor censored over five hundred words containing the most controversial and explicit sections of the book. At its release, the novel was proclaimed “stupid and vulgar,” “dull and nasty,” “poisonous,” “coarse and crude,” and a work that “delights in dirtiness and confesses its delight.”

This is a story of a young man, Dorian Gray, who is vain, hedonistic and virtue-less. Realizing that his beauty and youth will fade, Dorian decides to sell his soul on the condition that the picture will age and fade and that he will stay beautiful and unaltered. Once the pact is made, he uses this mask to pursue all manners of deplorable debaucheries. Although he remains unchanged, the portrait grows increasingly hideous and records every sin.

It would seem that Oscar Wilde, in publishing his book, wished to unveil his own mask, his own “portrait” that recorded his secret life. Perhaps he was tired of carrying the burden of a hidden, alternate self, or more, wanted to finally be recognized and accepted for just who he was.

So would say homosexuals. For that was the darkness both the story character and the author plunged into (along with, for the story character at least, taking drugs, torturing friends and murdering). And it was the explicit homosexual portions of the book that were censored (both versions of the book, however, are printed today: the censored and uncensored).

It is not a personal opinion that this story reflects the author’s life – the introduction to the book makes it very clear by siting his inspirations: books with a similar vein of homosexuality and the people and himself that he patterned the book’s characters after. To quote the introduction, “Scrutinized by critics who questioned its morality, the novel portrays the author’s internal battles and arrives at the disturbing possibility that ‘ugliness is the only reality.'”

I understand why the world would wholeheartedly deem this a classic. I fail to see why this should be on any Christian’s recommended reading list.

I did not finish the book.

**Like my reviews? Then you should follow me! Because I have hundreds more just like this one. With each review, I provide a Cleanliness Report, mentioning any objectionable content I come across so that parents and/or conscientious readers (like me) can determine beforehand whether they want to read a book or not. Content surprises are super annoying, especially when you’re 100+ pages in, so here’s my attempt to help you avoid that!","Well I was tempted to just post a gif with someone giving a middle finger, but heck, I can do better than that. And honestly I want to explain (though I think my updates did a great job of that) of why this is from beginning to end pretty much one of the most disappointing books I have read this year.

I think at this point in time, many Americans have watched Gone With the Wind with Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable.

We all watched as Scarlett and Rhett clashed, how Rhett loved Scarlett who was too stubborn to let go of her girlhood obsession with Ashley Wilkes. We watched Atlanta burn. We saw Scarlett talking about how after all tomorrow is another day.

I saw this movie when I was around 8 or 9. And I fell in love with the clothes and sets. I really didn't get the whole Civil War thing (I was 8) and I was confused about the concept of slavery. Though I was a black female, it had not entered my head that a person could own another person. Of course as I read books and was in different grades I learned more about the Civil War. And what I learned was and still is distasteful to me.

As everyone noted when I posted updates and reviewed Go Set a Watchman by Harper Lee I was flabbergasted that authors out there could have characters speaking about state's rights when it came to what caused the Civil War.

How confused and just flat out ticked off I was by characters that actively opposed blacks abilities to go to school alongside white children as a bad thing. I wondered at Harper Lee's own beliefs and how much of that bled into her work. And I find myself wondering the same thing about Margaret Mitchell.

Mitchell was born in 1900. That was 35 years after the end of the Civil War. Reconstruction was over by the late 1870s so she was born about 20 years or so at the end of that.

Growing up in Atlanta I am sure that she heard stories from her parents, aunts, uncles, grandparents about the Civil War. How the Cause was the only thing that mattered, that Yankees were scum, and how the South treated their slaves fairly and like family. And how many slaves were not happy at all about their freedom.

If you ever read Mitchell's biographies she goes into this and what her mother told her about the War and riding to see ruined plantations (I haven't read any of these, just asked a friend who is a Civil War hobbyist who has read a biography about Mitchell).

So with that coloring her perceptions you can read her beliefs loud and clear (at least I do) while reading Gone With the Wind. And there have been many many articles, books, etc. on the fact that Gone With the Wind has actually led to many people erroneously taking that book/movie and concluding that was true to what was going on with regards to the Civil War. That the South was this gentile place, where women were ladies, men were gentlemen, and the Negroes were happily singing in the fields and not at all unhappy with their lots in life. That the Yankees (and how I got tired of reading this word) came along and ruined things for the South by trying to force freedom on those that didn't want to be free. That all of the state's that seceded did so because they refused to be ground under the boot of the North.

The plot for this book is very simple. It follows the character of Scarlett O'Hara, living in Georgia, from the age of 16 to 28 years old during the Civil War and Reconstruction era in the United States. Written in the third person, we get to delve at times into other character's heads here and there, however, our main focal point is Scarlett.

At times I will say that I admired the character of Scarlett. A woman running her own business, making her own decisions, and doing accounts better than a man was definitely ahead of her times. But other than that, there was not much to like or root for with regards to this character.

Initially readers find out that Scarlett marries her first husband because she's mad that Ashley (a man she really knows not a thing about and who she has built up in her own mind) is going to marry someone she feels is beneath him. Marry in haste and repent at leisure was definitely a saying meant for her. We get to read about her very sad and short marriage which produces her first child. Afterwards we don't really get a sense besides pages here and there about what was going on at the same time. We have Scarlett continuously going from her home at Tara to Atlanta to stay with an aunt and Melanie Wilkes (Ashley's now wife) and Scarlett doing so just so could hear any word of Ashley.

At this point the word pathetic came to mind many times to me while reading about Scarlett.

And this is seriously the whole book. It is a lot of reading about Scarlett's machinations of those around her in order to stay close to Ashley. They have some conversations here and there, but man, I wanted to say wake up to her repeatedly.

Scarlett is not written very well in my opinion. Neither are a lot of other characters except for Melanie Wilkes. That was the only character that I found to be complex, to have hidden depths and strength that I was very interested in reading more about. I wish that someone had thought to write a story from her point of view. I would read that.

Scarlett is at times a femme fetale, and other times act as if she's a child. She's smart about business, but really dumb about life and what her actions could mean for her and her children. This makes no sense because we heard about her upbringing by her very rules following mother. So every time Scarlett did something, like inviting people she knew would not be accepted by polite society to her parties, her being shocked at being cut made me roll my eyes.

Rhett was a typical romantic hero. Rude, brash, but very sexual in his dealings with Scarlett. I think readers were supposed to find him charming. I did not. I think it was because even though at times he said some oddly poetic and true things, he like many of the characters tended to show their hypocrisy a few pages later when something came up that could cause them problems.

Case in point, Rhett refuses to volunteer for the Cause until Atlanta falls. Though he did serve (only 8 months) he refuses to talk about it and doesn't care what people say about him. In fact, this is how he appeals to Scarlett, by making her not care what people think and for the two of them and her children to make their own way in the world. Then Scarlett has his child, and all of a sudden he is worried about what would people think of her based on his actions. Apparently he didn't care a thing about what people thought until they had a baby though by all accounts in this book he did love and care for Scarlett's two children. There are numerous actions by Rhett that did not make me sympathize with him at all. Another action was when he took Bonnie away after he had a fight with Scarlett but left the other two children there.

I actually felt for Scarlett quite a bit because all along Rhett has been telling her that she shouldn't care what others think. When she finally takes his advice, he then acts as if everything she has done is wrong, and she needs to be totally different (though he praised her for business acumen and was quite happy with how smart she was when they first married) in order to fit in with the polite society that was happily rejecting them at the time.

There are a multitude of characters in this book that you may be pressed to keep a sheet on, since they come and go throughout the book. For me, most of the characters were cardboard cutouts. For example, the character of Ashley Wilkes was maybe an inch deep as a character. Ashley Wilkes goes on and on about things in the past, wants Scarlett, doesn't want her, does thing that call into question his manhood, and there is not much to him. I think if Mitchell wanted to make him a viable romantic hero for Scarlett there should have been more interaction with these two. And also we should have seen that he was about something. Based on the very little we get about Ashley, as a cold reader, I found him to be lacking and didn't need the character of Rhett always pointing out his flaws to Scarlett.

The writing was crude (there are a lot of slurs against several races in this book) and not in my opinion very good. I think the problem was that anytime a not learned white character spoke, the dialogue became unreadable. I started to hate it when a black character spoke at all. It would take me at least 2-3 minutes to decipher what in the world they were supposed to be saying. Same issue I had with characters like Archie speaking (he being the mountain man that hated women and Negroes) with him sounding like he had never heard the English language. This is a style I hate in books. Also there is a lot of Southerners were treated wrong by the North passages you had to get through. I had to read through how bad Reconstruction was, how without the Klu Klux clan running around poor white women were going to be accosted by angry apelike black men, how crooked the Democrats were, etc. It was just all over the place.

It also didn't help that most of this book was just plain filler. Reading about the actions of the North during the Civil War in long passages at times combined two different genres together for me that did not work well. MItchell was ultimately writing a romance novel, however, it is crammed with historical events that make the book read like a history book. I love history, but this was so boring and slowed the entire book down when the pacing should have stayed consistent.

And that to me leads me to the other problem. The flow of this book. It was all over the place. Told in five parts (and really long parts) the whole book felt overly long. Sometimes the book flowed wonderfully (when Scarlett gets back to Tara with Melanie, her baby, and her son) and then at other times you just read and read and want the end to come (when Scarlett marries Frank Marshall and starts her business) and you realize, nope, more chapters yet to come. The chapters ended on odd notes, there were multiple story climaxes and then when you do get to the end you just feel relief you stuck with it and got done with the book.

The settings of places such as Tara were actually written quite well. I could picture Tara, Twelve Oaks (the Wilkes plantation) and a few of the other plantations that were nearby Tara. However, Atlanta, the homes there, the places, none of that read real to me at all which is surprising. Mitchell crams a lot into this book, but it seemed to me, that if I had not none that Mitchell was born and raised in Atlanta, I would have assumed she had never been there. That is one thing that will drive me a bit crazy when reading a book. I want to feel as if I am at the place that the author describes. I want to imagine it in my own head. Atlanta felt like a mythical place that could not exist based on the way that Mitchell describes it.

The ending when it comes was not surprising at all. Foreshadowing is all over this book as you read it. You know what the end is going to be for Scarlett. Though a lot of people read hope into her lines of ""well tomorrow is another day"" while watching the movie, I would say they (Hollywood movie) interpreted that wrong. In the end, Scarlett realized how childish and futile it was saying that tomorrow is another day. That she needed to start seeing things for how they were and being a better person. One thing is true, she wants to return to Tara (where she always turns to when things go badly for her, and where she goes to get strong) which leads me as a reader to believe that once she returns she will get what she wants in the end.

All in all, I would say only read Gone With the Wind if it's on a list you have for books you want to read before you die. It did not enlighten me at all. I did not find it that great of a book, and I would not recommend it.",,"If you ask me if I remember something of this book, my answer would be: nope.
I remember that I read it, but I don't remember liked it as many people back then liked it. I was like: what's the purpose of this book? My friends loved it, but I was interested in other books rather in this. Yikes, sorry not sorry","This took me a long time to read for 3 reasons:

1 ) the writing is detailed and descriptions go on for pages
2 ) the characters were boring
3 ) it was racist garbage (ex: reading Jane Eyre while black)

I don't know if I stumbled upon an obscure copy of this book or if I just read a different book from everyone else, but the entire time while I was reading this I was looking for other reviews that mentioned the casual racism in this book and I couldn't find any. It is so evident that in this novel everything that isn't 'white' or 'English' is antagonized, and all the black characters are treated and portrayed terribly.

I don't know if the author herself was racist, but Jane Eyre certainly had her biases, and I am not interested in reading about characters that frolic about in high society while victimizing themselves and casting blame upon every single 'non-white' character in this novel, and casually describing 'non-white' characters as ugly, discolored, fearful, ghastly...etc.

This book can kindly go where the sun doesn't shine.","Now before you jump on my case, one star simple means ""I didn't like it."" Two stars is ""It was ok,"" which is not accurate to my feelings. The Lightning Thief isn't an awful book, it's just not any good. The concept is creative, but the writing is so sloppy, the dialogue so lame/awkward, and the plot so forced, that what you end up with is the most unimpressive Potter knock-off you can manage. I'll be honest, I hate Twilight but I think even that book is better balanced than this one. Riordan is sometimes even offensive. While the adherence to the canonical myth takes liberties which I think are fine, the Greeks themselves get the shaft. The spirit of the mythology is robbed, replaced with a kind of Ami-Greek hybrid that labels the Upper West side the center of the universe. It may sound trite, overly sensitive, but honestly, it really hurts the integrity of the mythos (ha ha) of Riodan's world.
Percy himself is annoying, the characters are stock, the feelings often forced or nonexistant. Fantastic things happen but carry no weight, and the thunder that follows allusions to the great pantheon is cheesy to say the least. I walked out on Jackson a quarter of the way in.",,"The worst book I've ever read? Maybe not, but it wins the prizes for Most Annoying Book, Book Most Like Nails on a Chalkboard, Most Histrionic Book, and Book I'd Most Like to Throw Across the Room.","In 30 years people will look at this book in the same way they look at Mickey Rooney's character in Breakfast at Tiffany's. Who said burning books was bad?

It is sometimes said that everyone has a book in them. In Arthur Golden's case it should have stayed in him.","For the love of chimerical grape! What a dull behemoth of a classic. I really enjoyed the beginning of this book but Hugo's habitual interruptions of exhaustive political/historical diatribes really turned me off, so much so that when he came back to the story I had actually forgotten where he had left off. It's like he just slapped some essays in the beginning of random chapters for reasons unknown.",,,"Most people don't cry when they're upset or frightened, but rather when they're frustrated.

""Tell me, is he always really rude, or does he save that for mundanes?""
""Oh, he's rude to everyone,"" said Isabelle airily. ""It's what makes him so damn sexy.""

These two passages pretty much show what is wrong with this book: Being rude means that that arrogant and narcissistic guy over there flirts with you and is actually desireable because of it and that normal behavior is actually unnormal.

Originally I gave this book 2 stars but after reading it again for the purpose of analyses of the representation of the non-white characters I changed my mind. Reading it a second time made me aware of all the flaws in writing, character and especially story that I had overlooked the first time. And there were many.

I can still somewhat see where the appeal of this book lies (a ""teen book"" that deals with nothing teens usually go through and romanticzes all the crap in their life [when it bothers to deal with them]), but it is nonetheless a bad book.

I would say this book is appealing if you start with fantasy and don't search for something difficult to read however and without much substance, but when you are already a few years into it, there will probably too many similarities to other popular works of the last 10-20 years (e.g. Harry Potter, Underworld, Twilight) to make it really enjoyable. Also once you apply logic to it, the whole thing pretty much falls apart and you start to ask yourself ""why are they doing this?"" And that is a question I found myself asking over and over.

One point of criticism is the author's intention. If she had already planned to make more than one book, I would say fine it fits, somewhat, somehow, but if not all I can say is ""that could have been done better. Really alot better.""
Another is the information. For the most part this book read rather like a sort of beginner's guide than some sort of romance, action or drama and her writing is sometimes difficult to follow so it's hard to know which character is talking. In addition the first scene of the book already starts like a giant big exposition and when you think about it that nearly all people present are supposedly experienced fighters you really begin to think that they are just idiots. The Shadowhunters as well as the demons blurt all sorts of stuff out and behave in no way like trained fighters or dangerous monsters. Also it seems that the author cannot really visualize what she is writing and alot of stuff shows that she apparently has not thought it through what she wrote there and apparently no one cared to correct her. She doesn't even seem to know what normal and especially healthy human behavior is.
The characters act like assholes, the constant exposition gets on your nerves, especially since it makes no sense, and it doesn't take long for the first outright inconsistency to crop up:
In the first chapter a demon was killed and not even blood remained, but later a demon poisoned Clary with its venom in chapter 2 and even after the demon was killed and thereby send back to its dimension the poison in her system remains. Why did everything from the first demon dissappear, but not from the second one?
And of course the shallowness creeps in, even Jace states that the second demon is of a kind that is too dumb to care that they are not attractive, wow, what a way to drive the message about the utmost importance of looks home.

And speaking of Jace, there is one part of the book that is a pretty good example on why he and Clary are such dysfunctional assholes (I am not gonna give a spoiler alert because here it would be on no use):
The potion Hodge gave her smelled pleasantly of juniper and leaves. Clary kept opening the vial and smelling it on her way back down the corridor. It was unfortunately still open when she entered her bedroom and found Jace sprawled out on the bed, looking at her sketchbook. With a little shriek of astonishment, she dropped the vial; it bounced across the floor, spilling pale-green liquid onto the hardwood.
""Oh, dear,"" said Jace, sitting up, the sketchbook abandoned. ""I hope that wasn't anything important.""
""It was a sleeping potion,"" she said angrily, toeing the vial with the tip of a sneaker. ""And now it's gone.""
""If only Simon were here. He could probably bore you to sleep.""
Clary was in no mood to defend Simon. Instead she sat down on the bed, picking up the sketchbook. ""I don't usually let people look at this.""
""Why not?"" Jace looked tousled, as if he'd been asleep himself. ""You're a pretty good artist. Sometimes even excellent.""
""Well, because—it's like a diary. Except I don't think in words, I think in pictures, so it's all drawings. But it's still private.""
She wondered if she sounded as crazy as she suspected.
Jace looked wounded. ""A diary with no drawings of me in it? Where are the torrid fantasies? The romance novel covers?
The—""
""Do all the girls you meet fall in love with you?"" Clary asked quietly.
The question seemed to deflate him, like a pin popping a balloon. ""It's not love,"" he said, after a pause. ""At least—""
""You could try not being charming all the time,"" Clary said. ""It might be a relief for everyone.""
He looked down at his hands. They were like Hodge's hands already, snowflaked with tiny white scars, though the skin was young and unlined. ""If you're really tired, I could put you to sleep,"" he said. ""Tell you a bedtime story.""
She looked at him. ""Are you serious?""
""I'm always serious.""
She wondered if being tired had made them both a little crazy. But Jace didn't look tired. He looked almost sad. She set the sketchbook down on the night table, and lay down, curling sideways on the pillow. ""Okay.""

This pretty much sums up what is wrong with these two and the book in general. Jace has no respect for privacy, relationships or anything not directly related to himself, he is totally arrogant and narccissistic but still everyone loves him for it. Despite the fact that he had been rude to Clary, her friends and often even his own friends, that he put her live in danger and brags about himself all the time she actually thinks that is charming, that is the reason she fell in love with him. And that she thinks he is charming came out of nowhere, there wasn't even a hint before that.
And of course this passage shows Clary exactly how she is: she cannot stand up to herself when its really needed, she only defends her only friend when she feels like it, she is way too accepting of everything, heck she doesn't even complain about this breach of privacy, every normal person would have kicked Jace out of the room for that, but not Clary, she is not even angry. And you can't blame that on her being tired, because people who are tired tend to be even more agressive than usual.

The rest of the book is really no better and I must say that I read plenty of books you can read over and over again and they are still good, but when you do this with this book, the best you can hope for is becoming numb to the pain all its flaws may cause you.","This book was way over-hyped. Right out the gate, I enjoyed the maids POV (could have done without the Southern/Black dialect), but disliked the main protagonist Skeeter. I kept waiting for her redeeming moment, but it never came. The ending was underwhelming, and the author never fully justified the risk that the maids took. The only beneficiary at the end of it all was Skeeter and also her publisher who obviously saw only financial gain in publicizing the story of black maids from the south.

In the end, the take away I got was that the white woman saved the day. Yet lives were ruined, tragedy strikes some black families, but Skeeter makes off with a fancy job in New York and comes out on top. I would have liked to see her stand up to friends, family, and fiancee, and say outright that racism is wrong. Segregation is wrong. Abuse is wrong. It confused me as to why she never took the message all the way. And her comment in the beginning -- about wanting things to ""change"" -- was never fully explained. And why again did the maids choose to tell their tale? It's doubtful in end what good has come of the book -- if anything, it could merely be a gossipy tell-all published for entertainment purposes (much how ex-nannies and managers of celebrities put out books today). No one stood up to anyone!

I saw some potential with Celia and her husband. Did Johnny leave Hilly because of her bigotry? Aside from her looks, did he choose Celia because she was so ""backwards"" that she saw past skin color and prejudice? I feel that these points would have given the book so much more heft.","IT ENDS! IT ENDS! IT ACTUALLY ENDS!

That would be the best thing about this book, it has an end, although there are times it doesn't feel like it. I listened to this book rather than reading it and it still dragged on and on.

In short. It was long. It was boring. It was repetitive. It dragged. It was even a bit offensive.

I'm left with only one question: How did this book survive for so long and become a classic?","This is my vote for the single worst novel every written. It is to literature what Manos the Hands of Fate is to cinema. It is difficult to even describe how bad this book is, but I will try. Imagine a ripoff of Starship Troopers with the following: idiotic subplots that go nowhere, completely unlikeable characters, terrible dialogue, and plot points that make you want to bang your head against a wall. Combine this with heavy pro-Nazi symbolism and you have yourself one hell of a bad book. An evil, insectoid race called the ""buggers"" (rather than the bugs from Starship Troopers) have attacked the Earth and must be wiped out before they can attack it again. Earth sends its entire star fleet on a 120 year journey to the bugger homeplanet to defeat the buggers once and for all. It is decided that a great, child general must be created to govern the fleet from far away via transmission signal. This is despite the fact that several of the ships are Death Stars and can destroy a planet in a single shot and we know the buggers (like the bugs) are dependent on just a few brain bugs to function. We found this out when the hilariously named Maori general, Mazer Rackham, defeated the 1st bugger invasion fleet. Just to get this out of the way, ""bugger"" is English slang for gay and the author of this book belongs to a far right sect of Mormonism that hates gays. Ender Wiggam displays his strategic brilliance at a young age by beating his school bully to death. ""If you fight brutal enough, they won't dare pick on me again."" A real child genius would go into hiding due to fear of arrest. This is because strategic geniuses can see many ""moves"" into the future. Ender on the other hand believes that this action will have no consequence. In fact Ender doesn't realize that when his opponent has stopped moving and breathing following severe head trauma, that he is probably dead. Instead of putting Ender in Juvenile, the adults think he has the makings of a great general and send him to strategy school. Imagine if the US army put Seung Hui Cho in charge of Afghanistan following his brilliant solution to peer isolation. In Starship Troopers they have laser tag at the academy because they are INFANTRY and need to practice. In Ender's Game the generals play laser tag to improve thier strategy. Ender ""brilliantly"" covers his pads using arms and legs and cheats his way to victory. Apparently the other kids hadn't thought of this and everyone is amazed by Ender's brilliance. Everyone except the evil Bozo Madrid who challenges Ender to a fight. Ender simply kills him and continues casually with his day. A virtual reality simulator is another puzzle at the battle camp. The player is a mouse and a giant keeps killing you no matter what you do. Ender decides to run up the giant's arm and attack the eyes and face. Apparently being able to beat any boss in Shadow of the Collosus makes you the next Alexander the Great. A subplot develops where ender's evil brother Peter develops a scheme to take over the world via arguing on internet blogs. People always listen to what other posters say on a blog and don't stubbornly keep thier own opinions. The people elect this mysterious blogger to be leader of Earth. Peter never does anything significant as ruler of Earth and this subplot is simply never adressed again. Now that Ender has established himself as the world's greatest general, he is put in charge of the Earth's entire fleet. This despite the fact that any instructions he sends will travel at light speed without some kind of warp drive and will take over 100 years to arrive. In Ender's Game his instructions are fast enough to instruct a live battle. Ender's boss decides to make Ender think that this is simply another game. That way he won't be nervous. He also won't think his actions will have consequence and will be completely reckless with the lives of OUR ENTIRE STARFLEET. Ender ""brilliantly"" goes with the strategy of getting a death star close to the planet and blowing it up, which kills the brain bugs. Instead of Death Star they are called Mass Destruction device and because MD is also medical doctor, they call it Dr. device. (I fucking want to kill Card!) The people of the future have been brainwashed by liberal propaganda and think the Buggers didn't deserve to die. They don't realize that Ender is the great savior of Mankind. Ender is viewed as evil and calling someone Ender is the greatest of insults. Ender goes into hiding on planet Brazil (I'm not fucking kidding) and that is the end. Unless you are severely cognitively impaired you will realize that Ender is Card's representation of Hitler. In fact many of Ender's biographical details (even age he lost virginity) are lifted from Hitler's biography. The real Ender killed the ""buggers""(faggots) along with Jews and other filth that deserve to die despite what libby propaganda tells you. This brilliant piece of art helps the reader understand the truth about our noble Fuhrer. HEIL ENDER! To be serious, I was very confused as to HOW IN THE NAME OF HOLY FUCK this piece of trash has fans. However, this is the same world where millions think Brittney Spears is good music, millions followed the real ender, and over 100,000 fucking morons worldwide STILL somehow follow the real ender. To be fair, most readers of course don't use thier reading comprehension and analysis and simply see this as a good yarn. The majority of the fanbase are normal people with questionable writing taste, not neo-nazis. Even still, GOD DAMN does this book suck!!!",
"I know people loved this book but I hated it. I couldn't even get past the first few chapters. I found it trite, slow-moving, predictable, not written that well, and completely unrealistic. I didn't like any of the characters. The heroine is judgmental and self-righteous. The plot has been done much better most notably The Long Walk by Stephen King writing as Richard Bachman.

Being a mom, I would fight to the death for my children (and I didn't give birth to them--I hear biological parents have even stronger bonds) and almost every mom I know is the same. To protect our young is our most basic animal instinct. (I'm a foster parent so I know there are some that wouldn't but it's actually quite rare--most believe they are doing what is best for their children when the kids are with them. Most parents fight for their kids in court no matter how bad they are at parenting.) I believe there would be mass rebellion rather than put up with this murderous game let alone make it entertaining. Plus, these are descendants of Americans, who culturally believe in rebellion and go to war at the drop of a hat, and it's not far enough in the future for that to have been beaten out of these people. I think this story would be absurd in most cultures but Americans have been indoctrinated into a culture of rebellion since the birth of the country.

The book might be entertaining for some but for me, it's completely ridiculous.","In my opinion, this is just a book about Victorian snobs talking about snobby things, and I don't like snobs.

It's my goal to read all of the classics that appear on the greatest books of all time lists every year, so I'm glad I can cross this one off.

It's possibly the most boring book I've ever read.","I hadn't read this book for several decades and wanted to reread it again before having my 13 year old son read it. I'm glad I did -- I forgot that I HATED this book. It's saccharine, idealistic, naive. I don't see how it offers insight into racism. It is just racist. The racist language is so hard to take, though I recognize that maybe at the time it was written, it would not have evoked since a strong evisceral reaction. But the basic plot -- the great white criminal defense attorney (by the way, I'm a white criminal defense attorney) saves the hapless black, do-gooder black man. Mix a little bi-racial sexuality in and call it a classic. Yuck. This book fails to explore white folks entitlement, nor black folks' reality. It is just a series of stereotypes strung together. The writing is beautiful -- I will give it that. But the story? Some basic themes told in the context of a sickeningly sweet plot infused with racist superficialities. Won't recommend this to any of my kids. To me this is an example of what white liberals, ignorant of their own role in oppressing others, think a moralistic story about racial injustice would look like.","No. No. No. No. No.

It's not often that I read a book and think that almost every choice the writer has made was the wrong one. Not least the decision to write the novel in the first place.

But given that the book exists and my mum lent it to me and I felt obliged to carry on reading, I found myself getting more and more irritated and distanced by the book's leaden characterisation, its clumsy font and formatting tricks, the complete dissipation of narrative drive and tension in distraction and digression and overwrought foreshadowing, and the water-torture effect of passage after passage of bad prose.

In fact, I found myself less and less reading the book and more and more carrying on an increasingly heated imaginary dialogue with Markus Zusak.

""No. You are not writing an Eighteenth Century novel. Beginning your chapters with a precis of their contents is annoying. Unless you have a very good reason for it. And it appears you don't.""

""Seriously? Death is your narrator? Are you Ingmar Bergman? Or Terry Pratchett? No? Well, then Death is not a character and he shouldn't appear in your novel. His ""insights"" do not add profundity to your narrative; they just highlight how awfully you are over-reaching. Also, he is a preachy, intrusive, ponderous narrator. Who telegraphs Every Single Thing That Happens. Before it happens. Generally more than once.""

""Bullet points and text fragments scattered across every single page are a terrible distraction, and when they are headed ""Newsflash"" or ""An observation"", they lead a reader to hope that they might either be news or, in some way, observant... You really didn't trust your story to tell itself, did you?""

""Real Germans speak German. In a novel written in English, we assume that it is being translated for us – part of the magic of the novel. What real Germans don't do is select a few choice phrases every so often to repeat at random. Once in German and then once in English. Did you forget you were meant to be translating for us the first time round?""

""There are ways to describe people that are engaging, appealing and effective. And then there's what you do. Frau Diller has a 'nefarious glare'. Rudy is 'all sharp teeth and gangly blue eyes'. Papa's and Hans Junior's 'metallic eyes clashed like tin cans in the kitchen'. Characters variously have an ""accordion face"", a ""blank-page face"", a ""face of warm silver"", a ""face awash with whiskers"", a ""face crayoned with pride"", or a ""cardboard face"". Tears ""grapple with"" faces. Moustaches are ""knitted to"" faces. Gaaah. What have words ever done to you?

And the plot? Suffice it to say that everyone is blown up in 1943, except Liesl (the book thiefof the title, though she actually didn't steal that many books) who lives to a ripe old age. Until Death turns up to take her on that long journey into whatever lies past the epilogue and have a chat with her about The Book Thief, which – it turns out – he has read and obviously thought more highly of than I did.",,,"I guess I'm not the target audience, but still, I do not understand all the praise for this book. It reads like a chemical formula where certain reactions are naturally expected from the reader, but I can't get past the synthetic feel of the thing. It's like those cherry-shaped candies Haribo makes: terribly sweet indeed, easy to digest, but not really cherries, for cherries aren't made of crushed pigbones and intestines and cherries have a solid core to them that's a lot harder to swallow.


That, or maybe I'm a robot.","One day, one of my high school English teachers and I were having a conversation about books. When I started talking about Frankenstein , an avalanche of syntactical nonsense came out my mouth. I love Frankenstein so much, and I made it pretty clear to my teacher.

She told me, ""If you love Frankenstein, then you really need to read The Picture of Dorian Gray."" Content in her recommendation, she said no more as I quietly yet urgently shelved the book higher up on my to-read shelf. (This was over a year ago, so how high it went up is up for debate.)

I finally got around to it on an airplane from Copenhagen Airport to JFK. With a trusted #2 pencil in hand, I started the book, ready to annotate. I was intrigued at first: the incredibly shallow characters were entertaining, especially Lord Henry. His pseudo-intellectual musings made my head tilt with a chuckle and an eye roll.

""But beauty, real beauty, ends where an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration and destroys the harmony of any face.""


Intellect destroys facial harmony? It's such a load of bologna that you can't help but laugh. And I found myself chuckling several times while reading the book, especially in the beginning. The first few chapters made it clear to me why the book is heralded as a classic.

Unfortunately, the more I read, the more I questioned everyone's judgment. What began as promising literary genius degraded into nothing more than annoyingly shallow drivel. I understand that the characters are supposed to be shallow and that the titular protagonist sold his soul to stay young and beautiful, but reading these characters made me want to slowly, scoop by scoop, excavate both my eyes with a wooden teaspoon until I never had to set eyes on Oscar Wilde's writing ever again. (Or maybe I should do that to Dorian Gray. My cousin Elizabeth explained to me that I should externalize those emotions, not internalize them.)

You may be thinking, You hate The Picture of Dorian Gray partly because the title character was awful, yet Frankenstein is your favorite book, even though Victor Frankenstein is one of the most atrocious characters in all literature? Trust me: I wondered about this too. Both characters truly are awful, but Frankenstein's story was, simply put, more moving. Whereas I found Gray's story to be awkwardly paced, decently written, and (admittedly) pointless, I found Frankenstein's to be a deeply meaningful, beautifully written, and poignant account of a selfish, egotistical fool. (Feel free to disagree with me –– and many have, considering this book's average rating is significantly higher than Frankenstein's –– but I stand by my opinion.)

Having said all that, my biggest problem with the book was the simultaneous eroticization and infantilization of Gray. Hallward, the artist's, attraction to Gray is obvious from the get-go. The same-sex attraction added some interesting spice to the character dynamics, but then Hallward and Lord Henry would drop lines that made Gray sound like a little schoolboy:

""'Just turn your head a little more to the right, Dorian, like a good boy,' said the painter, deep in his work and conscious only that a look had come into the lad's face that he had never seen before."" (pg. 20)

""'Man is many things, but he is not rational. I am glad he is not, after all –– though I wish you chaps would not squabble over the picture. You had much better let me have it, Basil. This silly boy really doesn't want it, and I really do.'
'If you let anyone have it but me, Basil, I shall never forgive you!' cried Dorian Gray; 'and I don't allow people to call me silly boy.'
....
'And you know you have been a little silly, Mr. Gray, and that you don't really object to being reminded that you are extremely young.'"" (pg. 32)

""Grace was his, and the white purity of boyhood, and beauty such as Greek marbles kept for us.'"" (pg. 42)


Maybe I misconstrued the quotations or am reading too deeply into words like good boy, silly boy, and white purity of boyhood; but all these descriptors make Gray seem like such an innocent little boy who's being sexualized by these two predatory old men. I couldn't shake this feeling throughout the book, and Gray's melodramatic outbursts only further cemented this image in my mind. I try not to be one who judges books on their content because doing so can be such a copout, but it seems different here –– whether it's from Wilde's poor characterization or his sick writing choices, I neither know nor care.

I'm just thankful that I'm finished with the book. It took me longer to read than I thought it would, but at least I can cross it off the list. Maybe I won't stab the book like Gray did his portrait, but I have half a mind to throw it across the room. (Externalize; don't internalize.)","after all the hype, i was a little surprised to discover that this book is kind of a trashy romance novel. also, it's incredibly racist!! and this is the book the washington post called ""the best novel to ever come out of the south""??? um....have they not heard of harper lee or, i don't know, Faulkner? pat conroy wrote the introduction, going on about how this book's better than sliced bread, etc. it's a bit mind-numbing because, again, this book Is.

~Idk whether to rate it 2 stars or 3 stars~","Somebody please tell me that a twelve year old who just saw his mother being kidnapped won't go around making jokes. Okay, I don't mind a few jokes, but i don't want a joke as big as this book. It actually took me over a year, after once starting it, to develop courage to finish it.

The first person account is one of most annoying things in the book, which twelve year old talks like that - I don't think Rick has it to enter psychology of a twelve year old. No wonder the guy in movie wasn't twelve year old; I mean honestly has the author seen a kid in all his life.

If you ignore for once the little trivia about Greek gods (which I shall criticize shortly), it is just a shameless coping, no, an insult, of Harry Potter series. If anything, it goes on to show, why Harry Potter is more than just a adventure story. Besides the little adventures, HP was full of allegorical references (to real world), wonderful characters and beautiful writing. She had managed to enter the psychology of both children and adults like no one else can. HP created in one a philosophy that can act as basis for a child to form attitudes towards such things like death, drugs, good or evil, hunger for power. This one has nothing of that. There is no way for example, that it would come so intriguing a character as Snape or such wonders as Platform Platform Nine and Three-Quarters.

It is just how timid mind of a gamer would have seen HP - fights and pranks. Just think of it, a monster doesn't die, if you kill it; and will come back to haunt. Isn't that the kind of thing, that happens in video games?

Now the only argument in favor of book was connections it made to Greek goods. Here are four replies that can be made against it:

1. The basic system is stolen from HP - full time school became summer school, Greek creatures rather than magical ones and so on.

2.Anyone in our generation knows about Greek gods, there are video games and movies all over places, and it is internet age friends. Hades actually looks like same character from Disney cartoon series 'Hercules'.

3. This is most important argument, it was stupid. I mean just give it a thought - 'spirit of western civilization', I mean are you kidding me. what about eastern, northern and southern civilizations - do they have gods too? and if these children of gods are so undesired, how come they are called heroes? What about children gods would have with goddesses? Will they be immortal? because in that case, we must have a population explosion of gods.

I normally don't care about logic that much, if it is a good story but it is just nonsense redefined. I mean, I never asked the logic of wands in HP but that was because Rowling made it look real.

Yes, it is a best seller but that doesn't make it a great book, does it? HP fans were hungry for more and so switched to sub-prime authors. And don't tell me that i'm too old to like it, I read children books all the same. I could go on criticizing the book but i don't see any point in doing that.

Instead of reading it, I would recommend reading HP; and if you have read it, read it again and if you have already read it twice; just give it one more reading - it would still have much more in it than Percy Jackson.",,"I confess my crime that I never actually finished this book.

The Digressions
Perhaps with a 300 word discussion about baseball or elephants or something equally irrelevant to the topic at hand? I mean what the fuck is up with the digressions? Page after page after page on some Napoleonic battle or the sewers of Paris or some other equally tangential topic. Was this guy paid by the word? (Ans: no, but Dickens was and oh how it shows)

The Coincidences
And then there's the coincidences. I hadn't read any reviews before starting in on either book, which was perhaps a good idea as I don't know if I'd have had he will to throw myself into either thousand page slog, but some of the reviews were spot on, as with this example:

In this gargantuan novel, everything seems utterly improbable. Every plot operates through coincidence. One way in which Hugo emphasises the coincidences in his novel is the persistent failures of recognition. This occurs on the level of the characters - where a father does not recognise his son, or a criminal does not recognise the very person he has been pursuing for years. And it occurs on the level of the narration, where the narrator withholds the name of a character throughout an entire episode.

The Characters
Les Mis is fully stocked with a cast of thin, vague, uninteresting allegories, beginning with Jean Valjean, a Christ-like figure whose saintliness is beyond parody:
At the novel's climax, Hugo describes how Marius ""began to have an inkling of how incredibly lofty and solemn a figure this Jean Valjean was. An unheard-of virtue appeared to him, supreme and meek, humble in its immensity. The convict was transfigured into Christ.

Alex Bellos: unlike Dostoyevsky or Tolstoy, Hugo does not provide us with an in-depth psychological study of Valjean. Instead, Valjean is revealed through his actions, much in the manner of the lives of the saints.

Another critic says:
These characters live much closer to the realm of medieval allegory than that of modernist fiction, and reading Les Misérables, you quickly determine that there is no reason to linger over paragraphs sussing out the characters’ subtleties; what few they possess are rendered so boldly as to resemble neon nuances, and Hugo himself tells you about all of the subtext right there in the text, sometimes twice.

And the others are as bad. Marius is a bland nonentity, Fantine a character a Hollywood script-writer would reject as too ridiculous, and Javert a preposterous villain, his motivation pretty much non-existent and sketched in a couple of paragraphs. Which is telling, as there's one thing you can't accuse Hugo of, and that's a lack of detail.

The style
To describe his work in progress, he jotted down a list of hyperbolic adjectives: ""Astounding, extraordinary, surprising, superhuman, supernatural, unheard of, savage, sinister, formidable, gigantic, savage, colossal, monstrous, deformed, disturbed, electrifying, lugubrious, funereal, hideous, terrifying, shadowy, mysterious, fantastic, nocturnal, crepuscular.""
That is so Hugo, using fifty adjectives where two would have sufficed, invariably to emphasise an re emphasise his overweening, mawkish romanticism.

He always has to intervene in his own voice, endlessly sermonizing. Social realities are not so much observed as postulated by an Olympian author. It’s at times like the garrulousness of an old man in love with his own voice. Reading Les Misérables, one often wishes Hugo would shut up.

Les Misérables achieves its immense length partly for this reason and partly because the bits of dialogue are in fact large lumps. That the prolixity is sometimes appropriate to the speaker—as when Hugo renders the empty grandiloquence of a trial lawyer or the drunken philosophizing of the college student who impregnates Fantine—does nothing to help you pay close attention to it. And the fact that Hugo will sometimes reiterate a couple pages of information, or restyle the same idea five ways in five successive sentences, may make you think that he thinks that you are not, in fact, paying close attention. Which you aren’t

No wonder it took him 20 years to complete.

All that survived of his preface to the novel was a single, dogmatic sentence:
""As long as social damnation exists, through laws and customs, artificially creating hell at the heart of civilisation and muddying a destiny that is divine with human calamity; as long as the three problems of the century - man's debasement through the proletariat, woman's demoralisation through hunger, the wasting of the child through darkness - are not resolved; as long as social suffocation is possible in certain areas; in other words, and to take an even broader view, as long as ignorance and misery exist in this world, books like the one you are about to read are, perhaps, not entirely useless.""

A few other critics:
Alexandre Dumas: it felt like swimming in mercury.

Flaubert said it was a book written for “catholico-socialist shitheads and for the philosophico-evangelical ratpack.” 'I found in this book neither truth nor grandeur…. The characters are mannequins, sugar candy figures…. You are not allowed to paint such a false portrait of society when you’re a contemporary of Balzac and Dickens.

Turgenev recorded a conversation with a magnificently pompous Victor Hugo in 1875: “‘We were chatting about German poetry. Victor Hugo, who does not like people talking in his presence, cut me short and began to give a portrait of Goethe. ‘His best work,’ he said in an Olympian tone, ‘is Wallenstein.’
“‘Forgive me, dear master,’ (Turgenev interjected). ‘Wallenstein is not by Goethe. It is by Schiller.’
“‘It matters not. I have read neither Goethe nor Schiller, but I know them better than those who have learned their works by heart.’”

Sound familiar? Victor Hugo, the Donald Trump of literature.",,,"this book was so bad omg. i hated basically every character except for isabelle, and some i hated more than others *cough* jace *cough*.

with clary, it was obvious how both simon and jace liked her. it was a love triangle and i didn't really care but idk after a while it got.. annoying in a way? (and i read 6 books about Aelin Ashryver Galathynius and her like love pentagon so it's not that i dislike love triangles) but at first i shipped simon & clary and then i shipped jace & clary and then i wanted to ship simon & clary again and idek anymore.

i really didn't like the writing style. it was kinda just really continuous and the author just told you everything. like you didn't know wtf was happening but suddenly stuff happen and bam clary & jace survive another 'disaster'! i hated jace's personality he's so annoying like stop pls. i liked everyone's banter but then jace was just there like hey guys and he's so stupid.","I picked this up out of curiosity, a ""see what the hype is all about"" kind of thing; sort of like the time I browsed Twilight in the bookstore (also regrettable). I got through half a chapter, I even skipped to the middle to see if it got better, then I had to put it away. I won't even start on the dialect and sloppy writing because that didn't actually bother me. But, really? Millions of women adore this book? It's 2011. We have a black president. Stop it with the ""magical negro"" stories already.

I cannot believe we still publish books, and make movies apparently, about a black maid helping a white woman have a self-awakening in the South. I say this as a Southern black woman who's great grandmother was a real life maid in Mississippi: That would never happen. I repeat. That would never happen! And to pretend it would, to make millions of white people feel less guilty by making one of the worse times in our country's history into a feel good trope for our time is just ridiculous in this day and age.","This is now my second time DNFing this. I can’t do it. I’m bored out of my mind. This book put me in such a horrible book slump I finally just had to stop forcing it.

I’m so thankful that books like this existed because without them, we wouldn’t have the awesome vampire movies and books that we have now.

We also most likely wouldn’t have the paranormal romance genre, which of course is my absolute favorite thing in the world.

But this book in particular felt painfully boring and very uninteresting.

Everything interesting that happened took place towards the beginning. I feel like you could easily shorten this story and also make it more spooky, satisfying, and eventful.

I’m crossing my fingers I’ll find some awesome vampire books this year that will scratch the itch. This one is not doing it for me.","It plays upon every 14-year-old's desire to be special in a universal way. I think it has the same appeal as Ayn Rand to 14 year old boys: it presents a powerful character that you are supposed to identify with who defeats all odds, mostly alone. I read an interview with Michael Moorcock in which he talked about this being a problem with the canon of western literature since Odysseus. The hero characters in our current myths (e.g. Ender's Game) set up inhuman values and feats that leave us feeling disappointed in the real world, instead of teaching us how complicated that world is.

Of course, it would be written by a right wing mormon.

At the same time, I totally fell in love with this book when I was in 8th grade.",
"I'm just getting started on this one, and coming off of _Never Let Me Go_, I have to say that I'm having a hard time liking it so far. Really it's the voice. To be in the first person, and that first person to supposedly be abt. 18 with little education... well, I just don't buy the way that she is talking, and it's bouncing me out of the story bad. It doesn't help that she describes a lot of things that don't need describing too, 'I watched Gale cut the bread'.... Come on, can't Gale just cut the bread? All the 'I' statements make for a rather tedious self-absorbed perspective. First person doesn't have to be that way though, naughty lazy writer. Bad, no Nobel for you. I'm really really hoping this gets better, and I plan to finish if for no other reason than further research into what sort of writing can become a best seller. So far though... well... it's agony.

Arg! ""Conducted, slumber, verve, tenuous, of late..."" Are these really words/expressions that this character would use? Really? I call BS. This book is driving me crazy. And yes, I know that these complaints make me sound like some diction harpy, but come on!

Oh thank god I'm done with this sad excuse for a novel. I read all the way to the end hoping that all the graphic nonsense would build up to something. Sad sad sad. The voice never got better, or well it remained what seemed to be a 45yr old recently fired psychopathic adjunct professor and I found it impossible to suspend my disbelief. The gore was never a problem because I never cared for any of the characters. Of course it tried to play at the themes of tyranny and brutality, but with classics like _House of Stairs_, and _Lord of the Flies_ Why would you torture yourself with this?

On evaluation for why this book has been such a success, I think the lesson here is action. It does buzz along at a furious clip, and perhaps when I was younger that would have been enough for me to overlook flaws. But I suppose that is why I generally stay away from this varietal of fiction anymore... matter of fact, I think I'll go back to that plan A.",I can't believe my professor read this 25 times. I am dead inside.,"I'm sorry, but I hated this book. I understand that the themes are important and all and of course I understand the themes because I had to write an essay on it, but I still hated this book. I finished it only because I had to.

First off, it was slow. So slow. Dragging myself through four chapters as homework felt like trying to walk through thigh deep mud. Nothing was happening. NOTHING. It went on like that until around the last 10-20 pages.

Second of all. I have bad memories associated with this book. I realize that this isn't something to hate it for, but I do. ANYWAYS.

Third, I didn't like the characters or how they talk. And yes I realize that I shouldn't judge people for how they talk, but I don't like reading that style of speech. I might take The Secret Garden off my TBR because I read a page of it somewhere in the middle, and they talk like how they do in this book. I'm not hating on anyone or anything, I just don't like reading it. Also, I just couldn't get attached to the characters. I don't know why, but I couldn't do it.

I feel like I never like school books. I didn't like The Kite Runner either. I read The Chrysalids in grade nine and it was fine. I think my problem is that I prefer fantasy and dystopian books as apposed to books like this. Because I found Chrysalids interesting and it's a dystopia. I guess I should get used to not liking school books cause it's not like the teacher is gonna tell us to write an essay on Throne of Glass.

I will once again apologize for my opinion of this book. This is the kind of book that I feel like I HAVE to like just because it's a classic and whatever. I know people can get really touchy on these matters. It just wasn't for me. Apparently I don't like ""classic"" books. That's the end of my rant review. Sorry.","INTRODUCTION:
*sights with frustration* This book. This book caused me a MONTH OF READING SLUMP. I don’t know what y’all see here. Why you guys adore this book so much? This book was amazing ‘til page 4. It’s slow, stupid and the masterpiece of boringness. NOTHING happens in this book. There’s 3 interesting chapters and no more.

When I say I had a lot of pain while reading this book I mean that I nearly quit from reading. This book is plotless and the least interesting book I’ve ever read. I don’t see the greatness; the heartbreaking WWII book I paid for. The Book Thief is a simple as a paper leaf, and I think a blank paper leaf has more content than this… book.

PLOT:
Is inexistent, bye.

Now seriously, The Book Thief tells the story of… the book thief. A German girl steals books to feed her book-hunger meanwhile the world she knows starts to crumble because in the middle of the Nazi-regime her family is hiding a Jew in their basement. That’s it. That’s the plot of a NEARLY 600 PAGES BOOK.

CHARACTERS:
Are they even alive? Each character has MAXIMUM 2 traits. Look:
Liesel: “nOt LiKe OtHeR gIrLs” and “LoVeS bOoKs AnD kNoWlEdGe”
Her mother: Hates her. That’s it.
Her father: Loves her. That’s it x2.
Rudy: Is horny all the time (As one does) and is SO BRAVE OMG!!!
(No more relevant characters).

WRITING-STYLE:
I think this is a failed Peter Pan. I read Peter Pan last year and I was fascinated by its writing style and narration, and reading The Book Thief I found a lot of “similar” things, but in The Book Thief is like a low-quality copy. This book is like a wanna-be Peter Pan, but Zusak’s writing style is boring and flat.

OVERALL THOUGHTS:
I really wanted to love this book. I was reading it in a book club and EVERYONE loved it but me, and I don’t know what they’re seeing that I’m not. The plot is inexistent, the characters flat and the story isn’t inspiring at all.

I love books that are not that exciting and are more thoughtful and deep, I mean, my favorite book of all time is The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue, but when I was reading The Book Thief there wasn’t ANYTHING that motivated me to keep reading, and this book caused me a moth-long reading slump. I didn’t wanted to read because I knew I was reading this book and that I was hating it.

In her review of The Book Thief NAT.ourious says:“Just because you write a lengthy novel involving jews and nazis doesn't mean it's a great book or universally appreciated.” and I agree 100% percent. I think this is a very pretentious book. As a *sucker* for historical fiction and WWII books, this one was a complete flop.
I think the end is one of the WORSTS I ever read. Zusak tried to redeem the book with a tragic end (Which is no secret) but it is out of nowhere. AND NO, I DIDN’T CRIED, SO I FEEL ROBED AND BAMBOOZLED.

SHOULD YOU READ IT?
Another quote from NAT.ourious review (Which is amazing): “This book is for you if… you think a story is good just because it features the holocaust, Jews, Nazis and a bunch of kids being kids.”.

If you like books with characters with more than 1 trait and with AN ACTUAL PLOT, this book isn’t for you. The story was so flat that the characters felt flat too, but I think is a very unpopular opinion that I hated the characters, because even in the review with a rating under 3 stars, most reviewers agreed that you could fell in love with the characters, which I didn’t.

CONCLUSION:
I had THE HIGHEST expectations with The Book Thief. A book that was in my TBR for years and that a lot of people recommended me. I don’t see what y’all are seeing and I’m going to blame myself for that, but being honest, I think the expectations where the guilty ones.

I wish this were a 5-star review where I sat down and just said all the thigs I loved, the characters, the plot and all this story made me felt, but sadly, I felt nothing but frustration while reading this book.

I love books that helped readers to find a refuge and an escape from reality, and I know this book is one of them. I don’t think this is a bad book (Even when I hated everything in it), this book just wasn’t for me.",,,"After 2 months of struggling to get past page 13, it was only by some act of God that I made it to page 19 of this book at all. That's when I decided to give up on The Fault in Our Stars -- John Green, really -- forever.

I have no problem with existential musings and witty repartee but John Green's characters (teenagers, parents, everyone!) do this with such speed and aplomb it's jarring. I spent the majority of my reading experience thinking ""Is this dialogue for real?"". I don't mean to get all Holden Caulfield over here but there's such a ""phoniness"" to John Green's style that I could not/cannot get past it to find the heart of this story and its characters.",Well I just suck. I tried to be mature and read a classic but I was so bored. Like so bored. Wasn't Wilde gay? Why would he create such misogynistic and hateful characters? My favorite part of the book was when ... (won't mention the name for spoiling purposes) dies because it was the only part of the book where something interesting happens. I guess the upside to the book was that it was really short so I was put out of my misery rather quickly.,"I’m sure many love this, though I’m not sure how, after being incessantly beaten around the face by racism for over 1000 pages.

I’d love there to be at least a feminist angle but I couldn’t see it. Just racism, a triumph of a individualism and a woman with the emotional intelligence and compassion of a spoilt 2-year-old.

In 1000 pages Scarlet undergoes an incredible character arc, from an immature, ignorant, shallow, self-centred, grasping, manipulative back-stabber, into a mature, ignorant, shallow, self-centred, grasping, manipulative back-stabber.

I could deconstruct the racism, but I’m sure others have done it already. It’s exhausting and dispiriting. The whole this is just a racist wet dream.

Two things to note:

1. This was not of its time. It was written 70 years after the end of the civil war and the abolition of slavery. An equivalent would be a Nazi apologist novel written in 2015.

2. This is not just the characters’ thoughts and words, though lord knows they are bad enough. This is a third person omniscient narrator.",,"I am clearly in the minority with my opinion of this book, so I’ll keep my review short and sweet.

I didn’t like it…AT ALL, and I couldn’t bring myself to finish it. I felt it was a waste of a clever title for such a lame storyline. The main character Charlie, in my opinion, was an unrealistic protagonist who really can’t be categorized as a wallflower in the truest sense of the word.

When I think of a wallflower, social awkwardness and interactive paralysis comes to mind. I don’t think Charlie is socially awkward; he’s simply clueless and unlikeable. If I had to hear about one more event that made him cry like a baby, I would have screeched loud enough to wake up the neighbors.

I’ve never read a book published by MTV books, and unfortunately, this book has lowered my opinion of them and has placed them at the lower end of the literary spectrum. What a waste of time. But again, this book has high reviews, so don’t take my word for it.",I run a Jane Eyre hate account.,"I'm not going to win myself any friends from Percy Jackson's legions of fans with this review. Remember that it's just, like, my opinion, man. Now, I have harbored a love of Greek mythology since I was in elementary school and I found a book of such in my school library. I loved it so much, I am sorry to say that I stole it! Fortunately the statute of limitations has elapsed on that particular crime. I looked forward to seeing how this material was wielded in this extremely popular series, so popular that even over a dozen years later, my library can't keep any of its 14 print copies on the shelf, not to mention other formats.

First, the good: Riptide. Pretty rad name for a sword.

Then, the less good: the low reading level, the poor humour, the tired formula.

I can't fault the reading level on its own; it's not the book's fault that it was below my expectations. I thought a book and series that was such a breakout hit would be on par with Harry Potter in literary appeal. As it is, I found this to be merely a step above early-reader chapter books. I do not consider this a middle-grade book, rather I judge it to be for older elementary children in terms of reading comprehension. But of course, whoever enjoys it is free to do so, regardless of their age. I found it over-simplified, shallow, and devoid of dramatic tension. It is also supremely formulaic. Take the main party; the boy chosen-one, the goofy, underwhelming boy sidekick, and the competent female second sidekick who is the only one who actually worked hard to earn her place. We have seen this arrangement endless times before. The novel's opening and set-up uses extremely tired narrative techniques. The main character lacks any distinctive personality. Action scenes are random, with poor use of the source material. Supposedly humorous sections fall flat. The driving broader threat, that a war between gods would devastate the earth, is mostly told, not shown or felt by the reader, who has to manufacture interest in the characters' success independently. Overall, I thought the writing was lazy. I attribute a large portion of the book's (and subsequent Riordan publishing empire's) success to a powerful marketing campaign, rather than inherent quality.

And last, the questionable or disturbing: for one, Percy labels himself as dyslexic and ADHD, but does not appear to suffer any of the hardships that actual kids with these diagnoses would encounter. This does a disservice to those who legitimately struggle with these. Similarly, the issue of domestic physical abuse was approached far too casually, and is everyone just okay that this problem was solved by casual murder?

I don't begrudge anyone who has fond memories of this book, or any of the kids who enjoy it, but there are so many significantly better children's fantasy series out there that are vastly more original and that don't dumb down writing for children.

I do caution any parents to be aware of the need for a conversation about domestic abuse (and murder!) if your kids jump on this bandwagon.",,"I feel like a Philistine for saying so, but Jesus Christ is this a boring book. After the first 50 pages, it's clear that (spoilers for a 150 year old book) Raskolnikov is going to get caught or turn himself in--I guess sort of both, in fact--and then you're all set for 450 pages of poor Russian people falling into fevers and worrying that others won't perceive them as people of quality.

For a world classic, it's absurdly badly written. Some of this is probably the translator, but the bigger issue is likely when it was written; in the 1860s, it was more in vogue to write sentences like, ""Slowly Peter Petrovich took out a scented cambric hankerchief and blew his nose, with the air of a man of goodwill who has just received some slight affront to his dignity and has firmly resolved to demand an explanation."" I freely admit that I've been corrupted by the prose of our era, but that is a terrible sentence. You might as well say, ""Sofia was sad,"" which is exactly the kind of declarative and unnuanced description of emotions that dominates this book. I did not encounter a single interesting idea or turn of phrase in this book.

There are very few actually interesting characters in this book--Svidrigailov and Porfiry (possibly Luzhin?)--and everyone else is a one-note character whose motives strain credulity. I have never encountered a greater disconnect between how I feel about a character and how the author clearly intends me to feel about a character than with Sofia, who is such an insipid and inanely saintly character that I was really rooting for Raskolnikov to bash her skull in with an axe.

Anyway, someday I'll tell you how I really felt about Crime and Punishment.","It could've been a better novel or even a great novel but in the end, for me, it was nothing more than a Harlequin Romance. I guess that's a reason for its immense popularity.

Golden is not a horrible writer but this hasn't sprung from a desire for authenticity. It's like he's seeking attention like ""Look at me! I know everything"" The ""mizuage"" practice is a word as I learned from Wiki that stands for a geisha's total earnings over a year. Mineko Iwasaki the author of Geisha, A Life had helped him with background information while writing the novel and Golden had agreed to protect her anonymity. Golden had then listed Iwasaki as a source in his acknowledgments for the novel. So Iwasaki went on to write her autobiography, which shows a very different picture of a geisha life than the one shown in Golden's novel.

I skipped many parts of the novel. It was even unnecessarily long at some points. I read it because it was part of ""50-books-to-read-before-you-die"" challenge. Now I'm wondering why this book was really on that list. If you have this on your ""to-read"" shelf, pass, unless, you like a ""Cinderella"" in a Kimono.","Les Misérables' is probably the most difficult book that I have ever read in my entire life. Thus, what I have to say about it can be summed up rather quickly.

I do understand why this book is a masterpiece, and the language Hugo used was beautiful to behold.

However, knowing absolutely nothing about French history, trying to read Les Mis was like taking to my brain with a grater.

What I found problematic about Hugo's writing was his inclusion of long-winded soliloquies which provided his comments and opinion on the political climate of France at the time. This made the story incredibly difficult to follow in points, and also detracted from the charm of the whole affair. Much of the things that Hugo had to say were actually particularly insightful and interesting, but I question their place in an already very long novel. The book's story alone spoke volumes about Hugo's political feelings and presented them in an interesting and subtle way. This technique and subtlety was completely overwhelmed when Hugo launched into his political diatribes.

Most disappointing was that when I emerged from this reading I felt that I had gained absolutely no insight or knowledge about historical French politics, despite having read hundreds of pages of musings on the matter.

I suspect that the abridged version is much more palatable (and that is something that I never thought I would say). If you want to read about political philosophy against the background of the French revolutions then this is the 1000+ page novel for you!",,,"If Cassandra Clare has 1000 haters, I'm one of them.
If Cassandra Clare has 100 haters, I'm one of them.
If Cassandra Clare has 50 haters, I'm one of them.
If Cassandra Clare has 1 hater, it is me.
If Cassandra Clare has no haters, it means I am dead.
If the world is with Cassandra Clare, then I am against the world.","This was sent to me by a dear online friend, but unfortunately I cannot read it. It opens in the voice of Aibileene, a black housekeeper, who speaks pidgin English, while her white employer does not even have a southern accent. Set in 1962, it is obvious this is going to become a civil rights story. While I will quite agree that this story needs to be told, just as holocaust stories need to be told, in order that we don't repeat the mistakes of the past, I cannot feel good about its trying to do so while spotlighting blacks in a derogatory way. I'm sure it was the author's intention that they display their superiority to some whites in attitude, but certainly it is unnecessary to, at the same time, display their ignorance, make caricatures of them. With whom am I to feel a connection here? It appears that the heroine of the story is one who sows seeds of dissent. I cannot help but feel some irony in that.","I tried, I really did, but after struggling to finish 40 pages in 4 days I had to call it. DNF at 20%.

There are multiple reasons why I abandoned this book. For one, it was clear that there would be no surprises. Even having never read the book, I knew everything that was going to happen, because I have been alive in Western civilization for a decent chunk of the last 122 years. I was into horror movies and monsters as a kid; was in a play based on Dracula in high school; have seen Fright Night, all of Buffy (including the season 8 comics - nerd!), the Keanu Reeves movie, Willem Dafoe in Noseferatu, the list goes on and on, so Vlad, Mina, Lucy, Dr. Seward, Renfield, the sexy vampire girls, coffins, soil from the native land, stakes... I got it.

Next, the writing was not that great. It was okay, I guess, but I have read plenty more compelling classics. I expect that I would have no trouble re-reading Frankenstein. I have no issue with the format of novel-through-letters/journals/whatever that was the norm back then. This simply failed to draw me in. I tried to read on the bus but my attention kept drifting away. I tried to read at home but just fell asleep. The only part that started to grab my attention was the first scene with the vampiress trio, which was tantalizing. But, shortly thereafter, the narrative shifts to Mina and Lucy's letters, and oh boy, was that ever a pitiful display of weeping and internalizing the idea of ""the weaker sex"". ""Oh, I'm Lucy, and I feel so for the young men who proposed to me and I had to turn down, I'm going to cry just writing to my best friend about it, pardon the tears on this paper!"" Pbbbttthhhtt. The final nail was the attempt to portray dialects and accents in the friends' letters. The Texan speech was absurd, as were the following undefinable accents.

Last, I just wasn't in the mood to try and slog through it. You should know that it is extremely rare that I don't finish a book once started. I really should have done this more often in the past year; two instances that stick in my mind are Mercedes Lackey and co-author's This Scepter'd Isle, which was infinitely boring, but I kept reading because it was a buddy read of sorts. I also should have DNF'd Donald Stephenson's Lord Foul's Bane, which was vile on so many levels, but I did not because it often holds place in accounts of fantasy publishing history and I have been trying to experience such for myself. With Dracula, I attempted to manufacture similar motivation (classic/foundational vampire story) but given my overall poor mood during the days that I tried to read it and my preceding experiences, I chose to experience joy instead.

May this be the first of many DNF's in the future! I am now reading Joe Hill's Full Throttle and having an infinitely better time of it. Life's too short to not enjoy one's book.","I cannot think of a single good thing to say about this novel. This is puerile science fiction about a young Messiah in a futuristic society, complete with a trite ""spiritual"" message at the end, all told with terribly written dialogue, two-dimensional characters (at best) and questionable storytelling skills.

(Card also seems to have a fascination with little boys' butts - I cannot count how many times he used the term ""butt wiggler"", ""butt sniffer"" or described a ""wiggling butt"" or something else that involved a boy's posterior region. I get that Card was trying to imitate juvenile name-calling, but come on! If you're such a great storyteller with such an ear for dialogue, and gifted children's dialogue at that - read the self-congratulatory introduction and you'll know what I'm talking about - you should be able to find another PG insult, right?)

I hated everything about this book. Even the ""best"" part of the book (and trust me, I use that term very loosely), a description of an epic battle, was only tolerable when compared to the rest of the craptastic story, and even then it read as though Card had written it immediately after playing a marathon Space Invaders session (maybe with some butt-wiggling kids, who knows).

If I could give negative stars to a book, this would be it. The only way this book would be better is if it had never been written.",
"This is not easy. The book was so useless and poorly written it nearly broke my heart to think that this mediocrity is so popular.

Well, let's do this:

The decision to tell this book in both first person and the present tense is a gimmick to pull the gullible into a limping narrative that could not work in the past tense. This shoves the reader into a narrow, if not tiresome, pov that dispenses with what the rest of us call prose and employs rather a line by line in-progress description of events that never show us anything. We are told this boring story with little regard for environment, coloration, or even useful description that might be used to draw even the slightly intellectual reader into this lame excuse for a narrative.

Oh, I know. The defenders will say, ""it's just a kids book. Don't you have an imagination?""

I do. A big honken one. But there is some onus on the writer to make an effort at the suspension of my disbelief. I thought the Potter books were fantastic and well written.

If you enjoyed this book, good for you. But let's not pretend that it is anything more than a Nickelodeon script writers lame attempt at real art. As art goes, it's a big FAIL. Can you imagine the list of greats like this:

Tolkien, Zelazny, Rowling, Wolfe, Asimov...Collins?

Probably not.

If you insist on reading this book anyway, turn your brain off. It's the only way you're going to enjoy this edition of Crapsterpiece Theatre.","Flowery, pretentious writing does not a good story make. Austen created stiff, one-dimensional characters, brought them to life as much as she could in a boring plot, and had two of them fall in love somehow. No one writes romance colder than Austen did.

As for the assertion that this is satire, I strongly disagree. The mark of satire is that it's very obviously facetious, such as the supreme A Modest Proposal. Pride and Prejudice doesn't obviously lampoon anyone or anything. Either Austen intended to write satire and failed, or she didn't and discriminating readers claim it is to make themselves feel better about having read and enjoyed a straight-up romance.

Readers wanting a classic with a plot that's actually interesting should grab Jane Eyre instead. Bronte is far and away a better writer and storyteller--and her storytelling intent is clear.","I did not like To Kill A Mockingbird at all. I don't think it deserves a classic spot. I don't think classics are books that kids are made to read in school. Everyone's parents have read this book so that is why it has held up over the ages. It wouldn't be as popular if we weren't made to read it. I am sorry for being so harsh. I like the plot but I felt that it took it too long to get to the point. I get why were reading it in school because it was daring for a person to publish this during the time. But still make something happen. There is only like two things that got my attention. Even then it just went back to being boring.

The one thing that made me like it was the characters. So many other books did this though and they aren't even considered classics. Some of the book went super slow and speed up at random times. It also created questions, which is good but then took a really long time to answer them. This discouraged me from reading it. It was a super long book but didn't have a lot of description like other long books. Also I think that Scout wasn't attentive enough. She also didn't understand some things so it made me upset. Honestly this wasn't a book for reading. It was a book for history class. The reason that I am saying this is for the people who will say that it was written because it was highlighting the stereo types that occurred during this time.

Making this book so bad for me was the unnecessary parts. Like there was a chapter that was telling us prejudices during that time and I get why it was there, but there was so much dialogue that it ended up being more pages than it needed to be to get to the point across. I actually kind of liked the middle of the book but the the boring end butchered it so that I didn't like the book in general. It was not that hard of a read either. Most classics have difficult words and ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" didn't really have any. I actually like learning new words in books because you are getting entertainment and increasing your vocabulary. Also I thought that some of the characters were bland and did have personality but it was like a lot of other people's personalities.

For example Jem had a personality and interests like many other boys. He liked to be wild and crazy, he was daring, adventurous and, liked sports. That is literally what every boy acted like and likes at that time. I mean some characters were original. But I think the main characters should be original. People might say that Scout is original but in this day and age she does not seem original what-so-ever. I also thought that it did not give you enough time to love that ""one"" character died. I would have been more sad about the death if they gave us the time.

The only part that wanted to get me to keep rearing was the part with the court case. It kept me wondering what would happen. But then it just ended in like three chapters. I think the book would have been at least a good book if they went a lot more off of it. Also at the beginning it was so hard to get into. Books are supposed to propose a problem at the beginning but To Kill A Mockingbird did not. In the first chapter it had long pages of just information that is not explained till the very end of the book.

Also in books characters are supposed to feel relatable. Maybe this part is just me but some of the characters I could not relate too. I have not been in there situations before. I don't live in the south and our neighbors aren't that close together. My town is a very small town but were so spread out and divided that I only know a portion of the people in my town. Maybe it is because there is barely any racism up here but I don't know. In this day and age there are so many different or no religion that barely any of us go to church and some people don't go to church. So my hometown is so divided that I cannot relate to the story.

I honestly think that this is the worst book I have ever read. If I was not made to read it in school I probably wouldn't ever pick this up. If Goodreads said you could give it zero stars I would. I did not like this book and I don't think it is a classic based off the classics that I have read. I hated this book.

**This is just my opinion. It doesn't matter to me what your opinion on the book is.**","For the life of me I can't see what so many people found to like about this book.

I have to say before anything else that in order to throw your hat in the ring of writing a novel about the horrors of WWII, you’d better have something considerable to contribute to our understanding of those years. This novel fails miserably. Hiding behind the biggest disgrace in recorded human history to release such a silly entertainment just seems like blasphemy, and a well-worn path for writers with no personal knowledge of the war. I’m not saying that WWII and the Holocaust are off limits for writers of modern fiction, but readers should be extremely judicious on how they accept these works.

As for the book’s cred as a YA novel, I think that it’s a terrible way to present WWII to younger readers who probably know little to nothing about the conflict. It gives a totally rose-colored-glasses view of Nazi Germany. I’m not saying that all Germans were monsters, but hiding Jews? That really wasn’t a thing in Germany.

I read half the book and had no idea what the point was. I didn't even understand why the girl stole the books as the story had almost nothing to do with books, although he mentioned Hitler's piece-of-shit book about 100 times for no reason.

Right out of the gates, I was annoyed at the way this story was told. There was an enormous amount of repetition. Chapter titles gave details that were quickly repeated by a narrative that tried to be too cool to be linear.

That same afternoon, they returned to Frau Diller’s, “heil Hitlered,” and waited.

Ugh, worst verb coinage ever.

Then there were all of the German words—mostly profane—that the author chose to include. Dude, if you want to write a novel in German, knock yourself out. I just got tired of the patois used in the book. Arschloch, saukerl, saumensch, and a few other choice words were used way too much. We have those words in English, so use them.

You see, people may tell you that Nazi Germany was built on anti-Semitism, a somewhat overzealous leader, and a nation of hate-fed bigots, but it would all have come to nothing had the Germans not loved one particular activity:
To burn.
The Germans loved to burn things. Shops, synagogues, Reichstags, houses, personal items, slain people, and of course, books.

If this isn’t stupid enough to stop you in your reading and throw this book in the fireplace, you’ll have many more opportunities.",,,"This is my third time writing this review. The first time I expressed what was practically outrage that something like this had been written because it was so horrible that I couldn't finish it (and I ALWAYS finish books); the second time, I forced myself to get to the end. And rolled my eyes, said ""are you f*cking kidding me?"", and wanted to stab Augustus Waters, only to be reminded that he is fictitious. If you really want to read those reviews (combined together for simplicity), then I direct you over to my Tumblr.

And each time I wrote this review, there was outrage and backlash. It seems that everyone and their brother has read (and enjoyed) this book. I know at least six people who have read this book, and at least half have expressed how much they love it. Nearly all of the people on my Goodreads friends list have read this book and given it at least three stars. This book is practically untouchable. Because this is THE book about cancer, THE book for teens, THE book for fans of the Green brothers, THE book. The book that is, essentially, untouchable. The only book I had (at that point) ever read that held a four and a half star rating on Goodreads. I figured, hey, that's pretty impressive. There's gotta be something good about it. So when I received a copy for my sixteenth birthday, I was ecstatic. I was finally going to read the legend.

As luck would have it, I started reading this in the doctor's office. Why? I had sprained my knee and it felt like someone was stabbing me every time I moved, similar to the feeling Hazel gets when she ""called a ten a nine"", although my pain was more along the lines of a seven or eight on the scale. (This is also a question I've been asked many times, to rate my pain on a scale of one to ten, as I am also fighting a disease and am about the same age as Hazel and Augustus. Also, no, I will not get into the specifics of my illness.)

I think it is my illness that helped spark my hatred for this book. Like most criticisms say, even from fans, Hazel and Augustus speak in this voice that is far too wise for their years. Many argue it is a part of being so sick. Let me tell you, like I have already addressed, I am sick too. Genuinely sick kids cannot afford to be so witty and oh so clever all the time. And trust me (I am not trying to be a braggart here, though I know it will come across that way, so sorry in advance), I have the capacity to be witty and clever like Augustus Waters. Honestly, when I was reading The Fault in Our Stars, I didn't hear the voice of Hazel Grace Lancaster, I heard the voice of John Green. I didn't hear the voice of Augustus Waters, I heard the voice of John Green.

I also heard the voice of Alaska Young and Miles Halter. Why? Because all of John Green's characters meld together in such a way that it is honestly impossible for me to distinguish between some of them. Take this quote, for example (edited slightly for ambiguity):

""I like that book,"" they said.

""Yes."" They smiled and leaned over to look at them. ""You would. Big white whale is a metaphor for everything. You live for pretentious metaphors.""


Sounds just like Augustus Waters, right? Hazel even said he chooses his actions based on their metaphorical resonances -- another example of just how intelligent these kids are for pretty much no reason other than the fact that, hey, they're different! If you haven't read other books by John Green, this might surprise you. This is the real quote:

""I like that book,"" Alaska said.

""Yes."" The Colonel smiled and leaned over to look at her from his top bunk. ""You would. Big white whale is a metaphor for everything. You live for pretentious metaphors.""


It comes from Looking For Alaska. In fact, Hazel and Augustus pretty much are carbon copies of Miles and Alaska, respectively, just gender swapped. I am not the only person who has noticed this. To me, Green is a weak writer, because all of his novels and all of his characters blend together. There is nothing different about the characters in each of his respective novels. You might try to say something along the lines of, 'Well, duh, they're by the same author.' That is meaningless. If I like a writer, I will often read other works of theirs. I have done this with writers such as J. K. Rowling, Markus Zusak, and Nicholas Sparks. I can differentiate easily between Hermione Granger and Parminder Jawanda (Rowling), Death and Ed Kennedy (Zusak), and Logan Thibault and John Tyree (Sparks). Honestly, though, if you gave me a quote from a novel by John Green and asked me to identify the character, even if I know the scene, I probably couldn't do it.

This presents another issue. Looking For Alaska also included the infamous eye roll worthy dialogue that The Fault in Our Stars did. Nobody in that novel was dying, so what's their excuse for being wise beyond their years? Granted, a lot of the things said are beautiful, but could they be improvised by a teen? Probably not.

I am a teen myself, I am not trying to question the intelligence of teenagers, as so many people have accused me of doing. I frankly don't care if there are intelligent teens. The fact that so many reside in John Green's novels is an idea that is tired. And it's nonsensical. I might let it slide if not every single character in The Fault in Our Stars was so bright, but pretty much every single one is. I also am a writer myself (albeit not published), and I would much rather be inside the mind of Saxon, one of my characters who is pretty dimwitted (and is a teenager), than be inside the mind of Hazel, who shows intelligence that even adults covet. This isn't because he's my own character -- it's because Hazel having this wit makes her a character I struggle to sympathize with, whereas Saxon shows me the kind of person I could be friends with.

And okay, if you're looking at the shelves I have placed this book on, you're probably scratching your head. Yes, I have this shelved as ""here comes the waterworks"". And you may also note that yeah, I did save a quote or two from this book to my favorites. Because just as it's possible to hate this book, it is possible to have a visible reaction to things you detest, and also find meaning in things that you really considered to be meaningless. Yes, this book will probably make you cry, even if you're like me and detest it, because it's heart shattering...because it's emotional blackmail. John Green asks questions in this book that no one wants to think about, raises issues that not one sick person ever wants to face, etc. It brings a visible reaction. I did cry. But the crying was out weighted by the eye rolling, the scornful looks, the way I thought ""there is no effing way"".

As for the quote thing, Twilight is pretty universally hated (and it is also shelved with this one on ""are you f*cking kidding me""), but when I fell in love, I saw quotes from that book and realized I sympathized with them. I understood them. The Fault in Our Stars is the same way. I didn't like it, but there are quotes that really did speak to me.

I think my biggest problem with The Fault in Our Stars is how overrated it is. Yes. This book is overrated. It is a very popular book, and many consider it a good book, but it is not the best book ever written. I have read countless other books that are wonderfully written that have not received the praise this book has, such as I am the Messenger or That's Not a Feeling. There are books out there that don't receive the praise they deserve. The Fault in Our Stars was not some breakthrough book. It is a normal teen book, and it is a ridiculous one at that. Because when Hazel and Augustus are not having meaningful discussions full of metaphors and enlightenment, they are being immature and talking about ""pedophilic swing sets"".

If you ask me for a good book about cancer, I'd recommend My Sister's Keeper. I've also heard nothing but praise for Me and Earl and the Dying Girl and Before I Die, though I cannot tell you whether or not those are good books, because I cannot find them in a bookstore and my local library doesn't have copies. And even though it's definitely a long way off from being published, I am also writing a book about cancer that is currently titled The Brightest Fell -- not that I'm trying to say ""wow, look at how good I am, I'm a better writer than John Green"", because I'm not.

I am expecting backlash for this review like the previous versions and the discussion I have started (which I am hoping will eventually die off, because I am sick of people telling me how wrong I am and that I just 'don't get' the novel). I am expecting people trying to tell me that I just don't understand how beautiful this book is. But it's not beautiful. It is not amazing. It is a book, and one that I did not enjoy...and I love books almost as though they are my flesh and blood. I suffer through books that don't interest me. I have read a ton of books in my life, and my abandoned shelf only has roughly four titles on it as of today -- two of which were for school, I might. I just love literature, which is part of the reason why my biggest aspiration in life is to be a published author. I expected to love The Fault in Our Stars, and it was so horrible that I would gladly give away my copy to someone who wanted it -- which I very nearly did when a friend told me she wanted to read it.

As a final note, I think most people that enjoy this book don't understand what it's like to be truly sick like Hazel and Augustus. Like I said before, I do. I don't have cancer, but I do have a serious illness, and one that I do not want to delve into. It is an invisible illness, so strictly speaking, I don't look sick, but it is one that is so difficult to live with when I am so young that I often break down crying because I wonder why I have to have it. Being sick like this, though, lets me know what it is like to be sick all the time, even when you're ""healthy"". And it is not accurately reflected in this novel. In this novel, it's almost glamorized, romanticized. Like I've said, I don't have cancer, mind you, but I do have an illness just as serious, and nobody I know that is young and sick thinks the way that Hazel and Augustus do. Because a genuinely sick teenager doesn't have that luxury, and because of that, this book struck the wrong chord with me.

All in all, good for you if you like this book. I don't understand your love for it, but hey, people don't understand why I loved That's Not A Feeling. Let's just agree to disagree. This is the most personal review I have ever written, so hopefully, you understand my point of view and respect it, since I try to respect yours, too. If everyone liked this book, wouldn't it be a little boring?","ive dnf’ed this book and started it again a million times and i just decided that i dont like this book which is unfortunate.

i cannot stand dorian gray. hes so pretentious and his life is literally so unproductive . all he does is drink tea and complain about his relationship problems. also this book is just genuinely so boring and has barely any plot. i dont get the hype around it ","It's a book that romantically memorializes the Old South, and what gets it challenged? the word ""nigger"". A book that considers the evils of slavery to be as nothing compared to the perils of (formerly) rich white girls, and that's the objection?

***

I feel compelled to elaborate a little. When I was twelve I read this book and it was awesome. I went from Nancy Drew to adult bestsellers, and this was about the South where I lived, and supposedly was kind of based on my ancestor who had two sisters, one of whom swore to marry the richest man she could find after the war. And she did.

I loved it because of the opening line, ""Scarlett O'Hara was not beautiful, but men seldom realized in when captured by her charm as the Tarleton twins were that day on the veranda."" [That may not be accurate, actually, but that's the way I remember it thirty-five years later. You know how many first lines of novels I've memorized? One.] See, I knew I wasn't turning out to be beautiful, and a manual to dating success for the less-than-beautiful is just what I needed. I loved it, my best friend loved it, we had the soundtrack album, we quoted the movie, we read the-making-of, and we laughed like hell at Carol Burnett's parody.

Melissa and I are still friends, by the way, and one of the things we share is the ability to recognize ridiculousness in the things we love, and carry on loving them anyway. [Like the descriptions of meals from the original depression-era Nancy Drews] And here I am, older, appalled by the racism and the rationalization, frighteningly aware that my mother's generation really believed this garbage. It's a horrible, sentimental love letter to slavery, and it's what every bigot with a rebel flag still treasures.

Really, it's horrible. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I discouraged Veronica from reading it. But I can't hate it. Mitchell gave the world a heroine of pure pragmatism and financial genius who was indifferent to children. I needed that. She also gave us a foil who was all that is good and kind and generous and brave and mocked her mercilessly. Yes! I needed to see that being a good girl was its own punishment, and that being daring was a good idea.

So, now I've done what I should have done before: I've added it to my ""Beloved"" shelf because it belongs there like nothing else, and I've taken away the stars. I can't imagine I'll ever read it again, but if nothing else, I'm glad now that I understand the thinking behind it.",,"This book was soooo hyped up when I was in 8th grade. I remember dnfing it back then and I almost considered dnfing it again now.

The story just kept getting weirder and weirder with each page. At fist I thought maybe I’m just not the target age anymore but I don’t think even my 15 year old boy-crazy, popularity-driven self would have liked it.

When I was a freshman, I had a senior boyfriend (spoiler alert: it ended badly)and most of my friends were also seniors. That’s where the similarities with my freshman experience and Charlie’s end. So many things that happened in this book were NOT OK.

The thing with the party where Charlie was in his room while a drunk girl was getting r*ped by a guy??? And he just let it happen??? Why? Who does that? No means no. And Charlie just straight up ignored it!!

Ugh, idk. Horrible book. No actual plot. Idk what was going on.","What an unpleasant read nowadays and, too for many, probably at the time that Charlotte Bronte wrote. Both she and her sister, Emily (""Wuthering Heights""), had a dark view of men who would become senior lovers of their heroines. Charlotte wrote fluidly but in such a high-flown manner that you wanted to put your head inside her book and slam it shut .

When Jane was a young girl in her story, she spoke and thought as if she were forty; and when she reached her late 20's, as if she were sixty-five. Jane Eyre to me was a rather disgusting person, eleemosynary to the point of nausea and the worst judge of future lovers as a boring person ever could be.

""Jane Eyre"" should never be assigned as literature, and if assigned to young people (under the age of 65) there should be a stiff fine imposed on the teacher.

Why couldn't Charlotte Bronte (1816-1855) have appreciated the voice, the viewpoint, and the craft of the writing of such female luminaries as Jane Austen (1775-1817), or George Sand (1804-1876), or Mary Shelley (1797-1851), or Madame de Stael (1766-1817), or even Harriet Beecher Stowe (1811-1896), etc.? Like many authors, artists, teachers, parents, it seems that Charlotte Bronte had her jaw set toward Gospel and a Calvinist pursuit of things which drove her to write inferior literature, for the most part I suspect. Too bad, because underneath all that starch, there was probably a fine talent that might have been another Jane Austen or George Eliot, which we needed.","If I were to add this book at the top of any list, it would be on a list entitled 'Weird, Random, and Stupid'.

Don't start jumping to the conclusion that I don't know my Greek mythology. I do. And I actually thought this book was going to be awesome.
First off, in my experience, any book with the word thief on the cover must be good (The Book Thief, The Thief Lord), so a lightning thief sounded very promising.
Second, I've decided I would not jump to conclusions on books before I've even read them (my mistake with The Hunger Games series, which I was totally ready to hate simply because everyone else in my class liked them and because Stephenie Meyer liked them).
And third, having recently read The Lord of the Rings for the very first time and still feeling very sad I finished it, I really needed another book series to get obsessed over (I'm actually still reading Mockingjay, but it's in pdf form and frankly I can't stand reading off my laptop).
So The Lightning Thief it was. I was given two days by the librarian to finish it, which is probably the only reason I did finish it so quickly. I wasn't exactly having the time of my life while reading it.

I just couldn't get around the absolutely mediocre narrative. It literally sounded like an eleven-year-old wrote it (I ought to know, since at eleven I tried writing my own novel and it sounded almost exactly like Rick Riordan). I don't like books that are too easy to read.
I also don't like books that aren't very subtle. As in, where everything starts happening too fast and the protagonist just takes it in stride. I really think this book would've been a little bit more bearable if it had set Percy as already having been a member of Camp Half-Blood. It could've been about Percy being an outcast at the camp of demigods because no one has been able to figure out who his father is. In my opinion, if the author has way too many incredible and inexplicably impossible things to explain to the main character, then they should just make it so that the main character already knows about all of it. This would be the equivalent of Harry Potter growing up knowing he was a wizard and how his parents were killed, and that he would be going to Hogwarts someday. I mean, it's alot to take in already, the existence of mythological monsters and gods, plus the fact that you are the son of one of those gods, without adding to that the fact that you are suspected of having stolen Zeus's lightning bolt. When you write in the fantasy/myth genre and set it in the real world, you slowly adapt your character to the magical world he will eventually have to save and then you pit his doom on him.

The other thing that made it extremely hard to like this book was that there were monsters at every single place Percy's trio stopped by. These were the 'Random' parts of the book. How is it that as soon as Percy and his friends get out of one tight spot they immediately end up in another? Given that they couldn't even stop at a burger joint without being accosted by Ares the god of war, or stop at a random garden ornaments' shop without having Medusa as the shopkeeper, and the nearest hotel just happens to be the one that holds kids prisoner for decades with its promise of an endless supply of food and games, I'm surprised Percy hadn't died earlier on in his childhood, along with half the population in Los Angeles.

Aside from all that, the three main characters Grover, Annabeth, and Percy were actually likeable and memorable - especially Grover, who was my favorite character - but they weren't enough to exucse the fact that they were set in a very badly plotted and disorganized mumbo-jumbo of a story that's fooling itself as an adventure with a mythological twist. There weren't any laugh-out-loud moments for me as, again, the writing style was pretty juvenile. There were some overly used elements, like a school bully, and the jerk stepdad. Generally, it was the book equivalent of a 15-minute animated cartoon. Probably only really good for an audience of 10 year old boys. A big waste of my time.",,The Crime is murder. The punishment is reading this book.,"Frankly, I am quite scared of putting this up since most of my mutual friends have rated this book so high...

There was so much hype around this book and when it was one of the books for our novel study in English class, I chose it right away, believing that I would enjoy it very much. I even went as far as to purchasing a copy. I was greatly disappointed by everything. The fact that such book is written by a Western man who claims to have so much knowledge about the Japanese culture is what upsets me the most.

Golden has turned the protagonist, Sayuri, with so much potential in being a strong character, into someone lacking a sense of self, fitting right into the mould of how men would like women to be. What is even worse is that he made Sayuri into a character who actually enjoys being objectified by men. A reminder that a geisha is not a sexual entertainer but an artist. Even the profession name itself says it, but Golden constantly saturates the novel with so much sexual content, convincing the reader that a geisha is different who they are. I felt so uncomfortable reading it the entire time that I had to remind myself it was a work of fiction and that such a character cannot exist in real time.

I believe that the author has successfully deceived many of the audience out there into believing his story, injecting in their mind the obnoxious love for exoticism. He has completely ripped the geisha culture apart and pieced it together into a story to suit the Western audience. He has written the novel in a way that appeals to general public's interest in foreign cultures, using concepts and themes like water, superstition, and butterflies. This entire novel is a show. Although I have not read Lolita, I feel like this book is the same case of deceiving the audience. Except, Golden is trying to write in the perspective of (has assumed the shoes of) a young Japanese woman while Nabokov has written in the perspective of a man looking at a young girl.

Good job, Golden, on paralleling with one of the prominent themes in the novel that is deception. I look forward to writing a literary essay that underlyingly criticizes the authenticity of the novel.

For more information about why I did not enjoy this book. Click here for an article that further criticizes the novel (and it's pretty much what I am trying to convey).

Note: I am sorry to all the readers out there who enjoyed it, but my hatred for this novel is rather intense. This review is written after several weeks of analyzing. I tried my best to look at it in a positive light but nothing is found. The water imagery was nice...but yuck.","I'm sure Les misérables is great literature and all, but it just doesn't speak to me. While I found his characters interesting and I loved the interaction between them, I was just bored to tears with him describing the setting.

I don't get intimidated by long classic works but there are too many good books out there to force yourself through something just because people (or you yourself) think it ""should be read"".

Les misérables is a great example of what happens when you're a genius writer with no editor and you get paid by the word.",,,"I finished this book without dying, ya'll!","If this hadn't been the assigned novel in a book group, I'd never have picked the book back up off the floor from where I threw it in disgust. I found this novel to be patronizing, insulting and full of brazen stereotypes.

But far worse than any of that, for a work of fiction, is that at it's core this is an incredibly poorly written novel. Poor characterization, poor dialogue and poor descriptions. Stockett does a better job telling you how you should feel than showing, and isn't showing the reader emotions the job of a fiction author? Stockett rarely wrapped me up in the subtleties of life in 1960's Mississippi, instead relying too heavily on telling me in unemotional terms how I should feel, what I should feel, providing a poor link between reader and written situation. The plot is creaky and predictable, and the few ""surprise!"" moments feel disjointed from the rest of the novel. I couldn't move beyond her poor use of dialect. Why were all Stockett's Black characters written in dialect, but even the most dirt poor white trash characters written in perfect English?

I'm baffled as to how this book has received such overwhelmingly good reviews.","IF IT WERE POSSIBLE TO GIVE THIS BOOK 0 STARS I WOULD.

Don't read this book. It's awful. The characters are all absolutely insufferable, and the female characters especially are written in such a way that makes it clear that Stoker did not hold very progressive attitudes about women.

And honestly? Even if you aren't as aggravated as I was about literally all of the characters, the book isn't actually that interesting! It's written through several characters' diaries and it just makes the entire book drag and seem like a lot of Victorian whining and hand-wringing, so don't read this if you're looking for any cool vampire stuff.","This is not an actual review. I'll just point out what I didn't like about this book.

· The writing was flat.
· I didn't connect with the characters.
· I felt it was too unrealistic.
· Aliens are not my thing.
· The concept was interesting, but for me, the book was boring.
· Offensive at some points.

I didn't like this book at all. It was not terrible, but neither was it good, in my opinion. My rating was not influenced by the author's behavior, what he says, or his beliefs. I didn't even know about this when I read this book, so don't judge my rating for that. I'm being completely honest when I say I didn't like this book. I know I'm the minority lady.",
"Despite the huge cult following of this book, I detested it. I wish I could've given it zero stars. Who wants to read about kids getting mauled and killing each other for absolutely no reason ON LIVE TELEVISION? Not to mention I hate stories told in present tense. I don't know why, I just like past tense. I have not read the rest of the series and I have absolutely no desire or intention to, whatsoever. To be completely honest with you I didn't even get through the first chapter; I didn't want to read it in the first place, and I'm glad I didn't. Apparently, it's much more of a romance than I thought (*eye roll*).","(With apologies to the zillions of Jane Austen fans,but hopefully,there will be a few people who will agree with me).

Painfully slow and dull.Nothing much happens for a good,long while.Disliked it all the more so,because I didn't even want to read it.

It was prescribed reading,during a literature class.That made it that much worse,as it had to be analysed in detail as well.
Felt like such an imposition.The only way,it can become a bit palatable,is to read a very short,condensed summary.

As Elizabeth puts it in her excellent review (rating it 1 star,and getting over a thousand likes,plus a whole lot of negative comments),this is ""inspid,and a snore.""So many pages of nothing !

-I set my expectations very high for this book, because I have read some very emotionally challenging material. I didn’t see it in this book.

-I didn’t like how the narrator gives away the ending. I hate learning about the outcome of a story before I read it. This resulted in the climax being, well, very anti-climactic. Too much foreshadowing to the point of revealing the ending. I don’t mind putting the pieces together for myself!

-Too long and dense—and at times—the language was too flowery (even for me). Sometimes descriptions left a bitter taste in my mouth; some were a bit trite.

-Repetitive (ex: Jesus, Mary, Joseph; Death’s interjections).

-Death doesn’t explain where the souls go, for taking up so much of the story!

-Cumbersome and passive language at times, making it hard to get through. (“Two giant words were struggled with, carried on her shoulder, and dropped as a bungling pair at Ilsa Hermann's feet”). It seemed overdone and tried very hard to be deep and symbolic.

-I disliked the obtrusiveness of the narrator, and I didn’t care for the bold points and the way the paragraphs were divided; it was not a smooth read.

-I was very focused on the literary devices, so that took away from the actual flow of the story for me.

-Writing style was too modern for such a historical tale. It would have worked better with a modern plotline.

-Too gimmicky, and I will never understand why people love this book so much. Sorry, just didn't work for me. And yes, I read the whole thing.",,,"I honestly don't know why I read this in 2015, perhaps for the hype? In any case, in that then I didn't like it. Did I cry? Yes, of boredom. This book it was a fucking hell and a nightmare. In 2015 I had several reasons why this book wasn't good for me, but now I can't remember any of them. I won't re read it but I'll just say that this was boring and weird.","OMG you’re so pretty!
OMG you’re so witty!
If I get a wrinkle on my face I’m going to be worthless!","This took literal YEARS to get through.
It is really hard to read in this day and age with so much racist and derogatory verbiage.
I had seen the movie as a kid, so I knew there was some, I did not realize that the movie was the racist ""light"" version.
Yikes.
The story itself is just okay, I am unsure why people love this so much.
There is a LOT of unnecessary pages in here with bits that have zero impact on the story/characters and just seem to increase the page count for no reason.
I would not recommend this book.",,"I will admit, there are some really great quotes in this book. And is that it? Or did I miss something here? What is all this hype about??
To be honest, I was overwhelmed by the concept of the book and wanted to love it. But really, I didn't find anything unique or interesting in it except for the few quotes........","Worst book I've ever read in my life. I had to for school. When it was done. I went up to the teacher, ripped in half, and put it on her desk.","The reader for the audiobook did a mediocre interpretation. His two accents can be described as sepulchral or yokel. Greatly disliked.

But the media form is separate from the book and has nothing to do with the author or the story he intended. So for the actual story, I was disappointed by the mosaic of Greek myths and characters being puttied together thickly with plot convenience and thin characterizations. The three main protagonists are often characterized as smart, tough, etc. but it takes them for-freaking-ever to cotton on to the many monsters who are trying to kill them. It's like they wander around all ""doodly-doodly, naive demi-god over here, doodly-doodly"" as some sort of Scarlet Pimpernel act. Except it isn't. They are actually always dumb enough to get caught but luckily smart enough to escape.

Ideological issues:

1. The book goes off the premise that Greek myths are actually true, and the Greek deities and monsters actually exist. Fine, I can suspend disbelief. But then the book relegates the last 2,000 years of scientific discovery to humans seeing what they want to see. ""The earth doesn't revolve around the sun, as science has proven and scientists have been silenced for in ancient times. No, it's totally a god and magic.""

2. Faith in the gods is revered, and blind faith makes you a hero.

3. White-washing the myths. Medusa was not Poseidon's girlfriend; Poseidon forced her in the temple of Athena, for which Athena punished...wait for it...Medusa by changing her into a Gorgon.

4. The Camp's name. Half-Blood. Is that a good idea do you think? At least ""muggle"" is a made-up word. Half-blood is a real pejorative term that I think should not be thrown around.

5. All the gods are dead-beat parents. Percy Jackson loves his mom, but she's been just as bad as all the rest. She married a guy for his smell even though he is abusive? Because it protects Percy? What, no.

Victim mentality, only one possible choice, etc. run rampant in this story. And that's a shame because the point of the Perseus story is that you can make your own choices in life, and you can defy fate and the gods.",,"I got through half of this book and then decided life is too long, and this book is making it longer. I'm sure in Russian it's excellent. In English it's repetitive. It says the same thing over and over again. It keeps repeating itself. It just says the same thing the previous sentence said. Yeah, like that. Do yourself a favor, if you're thinking of reading this book shoot yourself in the kneecap instead. It'll be less painful than reading this thing, and you'll have made a full recovery in less time than it would have taken you to finish this book.","What an absolute hot garbage.

You know it was written by an American when WW2 ended and Sayuri on seeing American soldier was like oh they didn't seem that bad. Like woman America dropped atom bomb on Japan.

If I didn't own a vintage paperback and my book club wasn't reading this. I would have DNFed this book.

What kind of stupid teen angsty bullshit was this.
Like nothing interesting happened in this book.Why do I need to read this book to know about the disgusting wet dreams these full grown up men have for this girl and on top of that this girl too has hot dreams for this 40 y/o man

I wanna book from the pov of the wives whose husbands make puppy eyes to girls as young as their own daughters

This is what happens when white men write from the pov of WoC
They find something fascinating about the culture abd twist and turns it and then submit it to its white audience as an exotic delicacy.

If you wanna read a book on Japan, read a book written by Japanese.","One of the few books in my life that I couldn't force myself to finish. I couldn't even get through half the book because it was that aggravatingly boring.

If you want to read about the moralistic trials and tribulations of an ex-convict that's actually exciting and won't put you to sleep, I recommend The Count of Monte Cristo.",,,"As it turns out, books that you used to like when you were thirteen are, in fact, not very good. I won't say there's nothing that works about this book, but the things that don't work are so goddamn broken that the positive aspects aren't worth mentioning. From the meandering, tension-less plot; to the mostly one-note characters; to the overwhelming storm of cliches; to the often comically terrible writing, to the girl hate; it's just not worth defending.","I saw the film a few years ago and I finally forgot enough of it to gain a fresh opinion of the book.

It made me half uncomfortable and half really angry. I feel like the author must feel really good about herself for writing it and not being racist and I expect that's the point of this book to make white people feel proud for not being racist.

The phrase 'not all white people...' is basically the moral of the story and we should be grateful.","Dracula, being the origin of vampire stories (is it? I believe it is), must be groundbreaking. It has left a huge mark and is an influence and inspiration to lots of movies and literature in our world today. So my expectations were up there in the clouds and this didn't even fly.

This book isn't scary. A book being scary shouldn't necessarily be a standard in judging whether it should be good or not, but this is Dracula. Not some Edward Twilight shit. I was supposed to be terrified. A lot of movies I've watched which were inspired by Dracula were much more scarier than this one. Even books. This book was so tame. Written in epistolary form, there is more telling than showing and that definitely ruined the thrill and the horror for me.

I don't even get the title. Why was this even called Dracula when he barely appeared in this novel? His presence is so underwhelming. We only get to see his form at the start and at the end. In others he was just disguising as a bat or as mist. Instead of the villain himself, this novel revolves more on the lives of his victims and how one death may affect others emotionally and mentally, also how that would result into. Most of the characters are annoying, Mina is a dipshit and instead of them taking down Dracula, I was actually rooting more on Dracula killing them.

The pacing is extremely slow. We get into the lives of these characters and we get to see what they would do in their lives 24/7. There was a bit of investigation at the middle but besides that, I wanted to see more suspenseful moments especially at the end in their final showdown. I didn't get any of that and I found the ending to be very anticlimactic.

Dracula is a huge disappointment. Being such a notable and well-known classic, I expected much more from this but I really didn't get what I want. This novel shows characters and how they would feel and react once they lose their loved ones but all of the horror and the grittiness I expected from this is not present at all.","I don't get the love for this one. It was a very dry read, and I felt distant and disconnected from all the characters. Also, I didn't find the plot especially compelling, which is odd considering the stakes presented.",
I had to huff and puff my way through this book. There is nothing admirable about any of the characters. The main character is a walking contradiction. The book starts out well enough but by the end it's like a Mary Sue.,"I'm giving this book 1.5 stars.
I've tried reading Jane Austen before. 'Emma' was on the book list for my first year English Literature course at university, and I tried reading it, honestly. I had to give up halfway through though (yet I still managed to write an essay on it!).
I decided to give 'Pride and Prejudice' a go because it's always in the top 100 books lists and everyone seems to adore it. And I must admit, at the start I was enjoying it. The dialogue was witty and there were a fair few characters that had some real spark to them.
Unfortunately it went downhill after the first few chapters. I just find Jane Austen's prose style very difficult to digest, and quite boring at times if I'm honest. As much as I like dialogue in books, there needs to be more than just that, and I felt that every page was so clogged up with verbose, over-the-top dialogue when there could have been a lot more.
There were many times during my reading of the novel where I was dying to put it down for good, and I was reading several other novels/plays at the same time. However, I decided to persevere so at least now I can say that I've managed to read ONE Jane Austen book, and her most famous and well-loved at that.
I will probably get stoned for having this opinion, but honestly, I could never read this again, or any of her other works in fact. I guess Jane Austen just isn't for me!","This is one of the most over-rated books in history. Harper Lee proved she merely got lucky by never writing another readable word. Is it a good story? Yeah, it's okay. Scout is an interesting narrator, the racism depicted is horrifying. Atticus is so self-righteous he's practically a caricature. Is it a great book? Not by a long, long ways. It was published at the height of the Civil Rights era and benefited by being politically correct at the time. In fact, it is still politically correct. But it is NOT great writing, not by a long shot.

Save your time. Bleh.","I know this will sound like heresy to most but I just didn't like this. In fact I gave up about a quarter of the way through. There may well be a brilliant tale here but I just wasn't engaged enough to persist any further. I'm not sure if it was the format, the setting of the story, the characters therein or a mixture of all of these. It just didn't grab me.",,,"Oh, joy. Just another typical love story, the same typical characters, and then the shocking plot twist: One of the love interests dies. *gasp* That was totally unpredictable and not something you could probably guess from the beginning of the story at all!

There were so many issues I had with TFIOS, especially with the characters.

Augustus, with barely even talked to Hazel, invites her to his house, and she says yes! Even though they've barely had conversation and they know almost absolutely nothing about each other despite the fact that they both have cancer, Hazel accepts the invitation to go to his house.

If Augustus wasn't 'hot' , Hazel would've thought of him as some weird pedophile. Because, according to Hazel, our witty and wise protagonist, if an ugly guy stares at you, it's creepy and you need to demand a restraining order, but when an attractive boy stares at you, it's suddenly okay to go to their house because who cares if they're a stranger - they're hot!

They've barely hung out at his house long enough to even think about a relationship, and they're already holding hands. Hm. Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is a firm example of insta-love.

Augustus's character was handsome, smart, and deep - he was practically a male Mary Sue! Oh, Augustus, with his inspiring words and his cigarette metaphor! *swoon*

Don't even get me started on Hazel.

Both of them with their oh-so philosophical shit made me want to gag. Their characters were extremely unrealistic. No teenager is that smart. In fact, I don't think any adult is that smart. Having severe illness doesn't mean that you instantly become full of knowledge beyond your years. They weren't non-relatable because of their illness, they were non-relatable because they were full of shit.

Three words to describe this book? Completely, outstandingly, overrated.

The only reason why this book has gotten so much hype is because the characters had illness. If they didn't, this would have never been a 'bestseller'. It was like Green couldn't come up with any ideas, so he decided, ""Hm, maybe if I throw in cancer, this'll sell to millions!""

It is not okay to romanticize illness; I don't care who and what you are.

*slow clap* John Green is such a genius, isn't he?

If you're looking for a quick romance story with characters as interesting as a piece of cardboard who spew pretentious crap every paragraph, this is it.","The themes that this book tries to accomplish is noble, but there are better, more entertaining examples about the idea of moral corruption. The antagonist in this book is vain, self absorbed, racist, and misogynistic. He spouts pompous philosophical nonsense that no one else in this book has the cognitive ability to refute so they simply accept it as truth because someone they think is intelligent said it. But how smart is a person in a room filled with ignorance? The author sends these characters on these self important, aristocratic soliloquies for what feels like eons and it is terribly boring. This book seems like a dystopia for wealthy, high society people who think that the idea of their wealth and vanity as a bad thing and not a sign of their eloquence over low-level society is a nightmare.
Maybe it would terrify Daisy from the Great Gatsby; but it bored the fuck out of me.","I hate this book and this movie.
I know many folks are able to view this book independent of the 'lost cause' narrative that it fed into, and that is still a problem today, but I am not one of those people.
Margaret Mitchell was racist and this book is an insult to those who lived and died enslaved.
I'm not sure how it's considered a 'classic' when it's so racist that it makes my teeth hurt.
I am totally judging those who love this piece of shit masquerading as a book.
It's just not that good, AND it's racist.
Sigh.",,"This book takes place in letter/diary form, and the reader follows 15 (about to turn 16) year old Charlie for roughly a year. We meet Charlie shortly after his only friend commits suicide. During the following year, we witness Charlie experience his freshman year of high school, as well as the following firsts: heterosexual kiss, homosexual kiss, girlfriend, fooling around with a girl, cigarettes, weed, alcohol, acid, gay friend, group of friends, and parties. Charlie is also exposed to or has been exposed to an abortion, molestation, incest, a fist fight, a teacher who takes a special interest in him (in a good way, not a creepy way!) dating violence, domestic violence and just about every other after-school-special, very-important-message teen social issue that can be crammed into one 213 page book. It was just too much.

In addition to the teen experience overload, this read like a self indulgent personal memoir. It came as no surprise when I discovered that Stephen Chbosky was born in 1970. Charlie himself was hard to get a feel for. We know that he has emotional problems, used to have aggression problems and cries at the drop of a hat. But for all of Charlie’s supposed self-awareness, he never gets to the roots of his introversion, passive-aggressiveness, or social awkwardness. He lets things happen to him, but doesn’t do much to control his own life. Besides Charlie’s non-existent social skills, he had a special sort of naivety that made him seem retarded. I’m not being mean here, he really and truly sounded mentally retarded in many of the passages.

p.167 “Did you have a senior prank? I’m guessing you probably did because my sister said it’s a tradition at a lot of schools. This year, the prank was as follows: Some seniors filled the swimming pool with about six thousand packages of grape Kool-Aid. I have no idea who thinks these things or why, except that the senior prank is supposed to signify the end of school. What this has to do with a grape pool is beyond me, but I was very happy not to have gym.”

Perhaps this isn’t the best example. But it sounds awfully young for a 16 yr old boy. Many people love this book, so I realize that I am in the minority here. But I can’t help thinking that the appeal is the massive amounts of taboo (for most teens) subject matter in the story. Take away the drugs, sexuality, and occasional mention of a psychiatrist… and there isn’t much of a story left. An ill at ease kid forms a one-way friendship with the only people who extend it to him…. The end.","The writing style is of great quality and far above the average capability of the modern writer. Bronte is very descriptive and uses great sentence structures and an extensive vocabulary. Much as one would expect from an author of that era. Unlike Jane Austin, which I read just before.
And that is all positive commentary I have for this novel.

It’s a story about an abusive relationship. Eyre seems to be delusional, maybe Stockholm syndrome? She completely venerates Rochester. Who is a liar and a narcissist. He is very dominating and depreciates Jane. He is almost abusive in his language towards her. Most important he tries to trick her into marriage even though he’s already married. so romantic… His treatment of his previous wife is very disturbing. There is also his disregard for Adele, leaving her alone at Thornfield, never wanting her around not acknowledging the possibility of her being his daughter and definitely not treating her as such. And that weird part where he dresses up as a gypsy fortune teller to find out if Jane has feelings for him. Also his regard for previous lovers and the part where he tries to make Jane jealous don’t paint him in a positive light.

This is not the only man worthy of Jane’s veneration. There is also this great priest guy who tries to manipulate her into marriage. Threatening hell and damnation if she does not agree to his proposal. Like most preachers Rivers seems to confuse God’s will with his own. Such a great guy.

Jane herself isn’t much of a person altogether. Next to her obsession with Rochester her other flaw I think is the lack of affection towards children. She herself an orphan and in desperate need of love seems to give little to Adele and her other pupils. She never thinks about Adele at all only Rochester. Later in the book none of her other pupils are named while she spend chapters thinking about and describing Rivers to the readers.

Thinking of the time this book was written, I don’t find it that surprising the pages are filled with the worship of its male characters. The five star rating I find a little upsetting but what I find utterly disturbing is people referring to it as feminist. Just because it’ a female author doesn’t make it feminist. In this case quit the opposite is true. More disturbing still is people thinking this is romantic ! Guys honestly !? Twilight or even fifty shades is romantic compared to this. Rochester belittles Jane and lies to her throughout the book. This is a disturbed abusive relationship.",Bruh.,,"The Happy Journey of the Classics Rudely Interrupted

""I would like to read you on a complete disaster of a book and why it should be buried!!""

My eccentric Scottish friend sent me these words well over a year ago - and how I have wondered if I would fulfill that request at some point. Well Alastair, you get your wish. This one is for you! Here is why I think Crime and Punishment should be ""buried""!

I will tell you why I found ""Crime and Punishment"" to be a miserable read and yet how reading such a book can shape our attitude towards the differences of opinion and style.

Not all classics are created equal and call me crazy but I hardly consider Dostoevsky altogether an author, much less one of the prestigious classical breed!

The plot - a young student murdering an old, unpleasant pawn-broker and having to deal with the psychological aftermath - could have been promising, if not for the story telling, the writing style, the character depiction. In short, if not written by Dostoevsky.

He goes into monstrous proportions of expressing everything in the characters' minds without relating any one thing to another or tying any of it to the overall plot in even a remotely tangible way. He - the author - is nearly as disturbed and as much on the verge of insanity as his protagonist, Rascolnikov, and while it may sound fascinating, it does not bode well for story-telling of any kind. He subjects us to every unfinished thought, every draft of an idea, every whim and notion, every passing fancy, fantasy and delusion in Rascolnikov's head and yet does not allow us to arrive at any possible sensible conclusion. Following either a conversation or a monologue anywhere in the book is akin to going on a winding roller coaster ride without the remotest thrill - and repeating that cycle a few hundred times until the last page of the book.

It is this miserable style of Dostoevsky's story telling which numbed my interest and robbed me of any compassion toward any character whatsoever, for how could an author inspire our compassion or interest when he insists on not telling the story and on not communicating with the reader and instead on leading us on a path which ends in utter incoherence and confusion?

""Crime and Punishment"" is a meaningless, maddening maze with no point, no beginning and no end, no purpose, no plot and especially, no prose.

This review is my opinion of ""Crime and Punishment"". Yours may be different. I can respect and appreciate it even if I do not understand it. By the same token, I should practice less defensiveness and more detachment next time someone tosses aside my most beloved novels or movies. We are unique individuals and the only thing that matters is that we always be true to what we like without predisposed notion, peer pressure, and outside influences.","Sometimes I do this thing where I only really read the title of the book before I pick it up and start reading it, especially if it was a book I heard was good or that I borrowed from somebody. So sometimes, I miss things like ""Book 1 of 10"" or ""not written by a real Japanese person, or even a woman really"". I read this book first on the assumption it was an actual memoir. It wasn't terrible, but not something I'd read again. Then I read the post script.

I'm not one of those people who would argue that you are not allowed to set your novel in a place where you didn't grow up. If it needs to be set in ancient china, or Arkansas or Cairo or something, then do your research and set it there. I'm not even going to argue that men shouldn't write books from female perspectives, or that women shouldn't write books from male perspectives. After all, novels are fiction - everyone knows they are fiction and are prepared to accept fictional and semi fictional descriptions of places and people. Good authors will gently ask you to suspend your disbelief for the progress of the novel, and if they are really good, you won't even notice the suspension at all, or even the request.

Memoirs, on the other hand, wants you to believe that it is not fiction at all. It starts by telling you that the Geisha is real, and her memories and writings have been translated from the original Japanese, via the cute little conceit of a ""translator's note"". It begs on its knees to be believed, and to be read unquestioned. So you will read this book, and it will seem very authentic, except in the places were it isn't quite except - well we've been told these are the real words of a real Geisha, perhaps somewhat fictionalized (it's a memoir!), and hell, I, the reader, am not a Japanese person at all, so I'll take her word for it. Then it's sort of amazing how America fixes everything, and how rigidly gender-stereotypical it all is. I almost believed it until the cookie cutter fairy tale ""Babies make everything better""(tm), ending, which came off as more than a little suspicious.

It then ends by telling you that Golden made the whole thing up and stole some bits from some actual real Geisha's story - a real woman that Golden chose not to write about, just use as a reference for his exotic Asian fantasy story. When you peel away the conceit of a ""memoir"" you get a hum drum, cliche romance story with a backdrop considered exotic to most north Americans. The whole thing stinks of exploitation. If this book were actually any good, it would not have to hide behind a fake translator's note and Golden's name in minuscule print. It's possible that a white American dude could write a good book from the perspective of a Japanese woman - I am not discounting that. I just really, really don't think that this is that book.","The verbal vomit of Victor Hugo! It should be titled in the singular and not the plural - le (livre) misérable - the miserable (book).

This book claims to be about the French Revolution - that was the only reason I picked it up. But it has nothing to do with the revolution; rather it is a shoddily written cheap romance!

Victor Hugo pukes words - literally. I don't think I have read a more excruciating and painful to read book. The superfluity of the vomit of words out of Hugo's pen is a terrible impediment to any kind of enjoyment one can have out of this book. Charles Dickens is riveting in comparison!

And what is it about anyway? A shoddy romance, and a misguided bunch of moralizing. The daughter of the martyr woman becomes just another pretty airhead, and marries just another handsome airhead - wish that the author retrenched on that verbal vomit a little to endow either of these with some semblance of cerebral prowess?

And a perpetual invocation and glorification of a god, that has actually allowed the most squalid unfairness to happen and therefore rather merits calumniation, is just plain abject. Where is the fairness of said god? Yet somehow it is glorious.

On the whole, a really sad and shoddily written book, with a million too many superfluous words and superfluous digressions, a pretense at relevance to the French revolution which is really not justifiable, and only a mere morsel of a story that the reader has to painstakingly dig up like a proverbial needle out of the haystack.

If you insist on reading this, read only the first sentences of each paragraph and you will not miss anything. Better yet, read an abridgement of an abridgement. Even better, skip it altogether, and pick up a Harlequin series novel!",,,"Clary is ~speshul~. She meets Jace who is also ~speshul~. A bunch of barely related subplots lead to Clary trying to find her mother.

Right, where the hell do we start with this car crash of a novel?

Before I read the novel
I knew (kinda) what I was getting myself into. I've read basically every bad (and some good) review of this novel under the sun. But then I found a download of the novel and thought, hey, surely there's some exaggerating to how bad it is?
No.
No exaggeration.

I also knew about the whole plagarising/fanfiction thing that was going on, but again I thought, hey, surely there's some exaggeration to it all?
No.
No exaggeration.

Present Day
I'll start with the whole plagarising/fanfiction thing first. Now, I'm not the world's biggest fan of Harry Potter, and naturally I haven't read her fanfiction. But even I could see where she'd copied it out.
Valentine rising again? Wow, I haven't heard that anywhere before, ever.
Trusted and loved character revealed as a werewolf? Nope, not seen that.

I've also seen some people say there were parts taken from Buffy? Now, I've never actually watched Buffy (and I don't ever intend to), but I have seen Angel. Admittedly, the only paralell I saw in that respect is the vampire nest in the old hotel, but I'm reasonably sure that if I had watched Buffy I would see a lot more references.

tl;dr: If this book feels eerily familiar to you, you're probably right.

Onto the work itself.

The Plot
Wait, what plot?
So the premise is that Clary's mother, Jocelyn, has been taken and Clary wants to find her. It's estabished quite early on that Valentine is the one who'd taken her. Valentine, by the way, is meant to be dead. Jocelyn was meant to have died with him. There's a lot of looming talk about ""The Circle rising again"" despite the fact that it appears most of the Circle are either dead or in exile with pretty much no plans to return.

When she actually knows where Valentine is, Clary finds her mother pretty damn fast. And when she actually tries to figure out where Valentine is, she finds her mother pretty damn fast. A good portion of the book is taken up on this massive subplot in which Simon gets turned into a rat and they must go to a vampire nest (in the aforementioned hotel) to get him back. ~12% of the novel gone to an entire subplot where all we get out of it is a werewolf attack which ultimately doesn't really foreshadow the Luke-is-a-werewolf thing. It doesn't sound like a lot, but it was a heck of a lot of wasted pages for that.

Take that as a metaphor for the entire novel. Unnecessary.

Also all the plot twists are pretty crappy and you can guess them quite quickly.

The Characters
Wherever should I start?

CLARY
See also: Mary Sue
Clary annoyed me so very very much. She's pretty stupid, needing things to actually be spelled out before she gets it. She likes Jace (how?!) and she's pretty shallow. Isabelle is taller and reportedly prettier than her, so she's as jealous as fuck.

JACE
If arrogance had a face, it would be Jace Wayland.
Thing is, he's so arrogant he knows he's arrogant, and not in a good way. Stepping into the real world, you've got people like Nathan Fillion and Robert Downey Jr who are both arrogant, but they're arrogant in a jokey way, and it makes them funny and likable.
Jace is not funny and likable. He is the anti-funny. He ""knows"" (thinks) he is beautiful and smart and funny which makes him none of the above. He ""knows"" (thinks) that he's being sarcastic when he actually has no concept of the word.

Jace is the biggest dick I have ever read of. He makes Cayne from Stained seem like a brilliant character.

SIMON
Did he even have a purpose other than being a Convenient Plot Point?
He is introduced as Clary's friend, although from the way he acts in the cafe at the beginning it's obvious he's going to turn out to be in ~tru luv~ with Clary. Aside from that, he only turns up to drive them around and save all their asses once.

ALEC
Everything I know about Alec:
-- He's gay
-- He doesn't want his parents to know
-- He ~lurves~ Jace (or at least Clary thinks he does)
-- He's insanely racist

ISABELLE
Token Bitch
She is there to piss of Clary (until a vomit-inducing scene at the end) and be a love interest (or not) for Simon. That's it.

MAGNUS
He had one scene and let's face it it was the best scene of the entire novel

LUKE
Was I the only one who noticed at the beginning that he was making Clary hate him so that she wouldn't try and look for him? No?

HODGE
Useful Plot Point

The Writing
Was godawful. She used a record number of similies and cliched phrases. If you played Cliche Phrase Bingo, City of Bones would win you a shitload of money. She also spends too much time describing pointless things, the dialogue is often awkward and unnecessary and don't even get me started on the fight scenes (which were fine when the characters actually fucking shut up

The Incest
I have a feeling this was put in as a ~shocker~
Oh no! They may be siblings and they kissed! OMG!

Please, I've read Game of Thrones. Clary, have kids with Jace and then we'll talk.

In short, I may have started reading this book knowing it was bad, but I didn't expect it to be as bad as it was. Will I read the rest of the series? Annoyingly, I probably will. Out of boredom and the fact they are on my phone if nothing else. 0.25/5 stars.","O.K., first of all, from the very first page! I found the dialect of the nauseatingly lovable black maids patronizing. Then there were wooden, one dimensional white people who were sooo easy to hate because they didn’t have one positive attribute comprised this recipe for a boat load of tripe that navigated the reader through a very long, predictable, shallow, poorly edited piece. Oh yeah, the heroine: the one white girl who decided to champion! and be the voice of the downtrodden! made it that much more maudlin and uninteresting.

Nothing in this drivel seems genuine, it’s all a rose-colored view of the authors memory of growing up in the segregated south in the in the 1960?s. There’s not one bold step, not one true insight. The whole book made me cringe.

The thing that amazes me the most is HOW MANY RAVING REVIEWS from women and women’s book groups this book received. I found the parade of accolades a little disturbing–are we NOT supposed to say anything bad about this book? Will something happen to me if I do? It couldn’t be worse than mucking through eight thousand pages of euphoric recall of what the author wanted to say, wished she had said, believes she said and thought forty years after living the life of every upper middle class white family from the South. Shame, shame!

I have completely missed the point of this story, this colossal tale of “I knew how it should have been so I wrote a sappy saga with a lot of crappy dialect to make you believe me!” Complete with mea culpas at the end. Please!!!

It reminded me of my first chick flick: “A Star Is Born” with Barbara Streisand and Kris Kristopherson–way back in 1977. I went with a group of 6 or 7 friends, it was a birthday movie for one of us. The theater was FILLED with women. The sobbing started about half way through and by the end, it sounded like a room of hissing, blowing radiators and honking geese! The music was unbearable, the story was stupid, the length of the movie was epic and I could not wait for it to end! Yet on our way out, I was utterly astonished by all the women hugging each other and crying, laughing at how moved they were. Good God! Were they serious?

I know I’m not alone, I am just in a tiny minority of what looks like a grand total of two: me and my sister Ann. It’s funny how we discovered our mutual loathing of this thing. We were chatting on the phone and came to the subject of what we’re reading as the conversation was ending. I tentatively put out that I was getting through The Help and she blurted out, “I hated that book! I couldn’t even finish it!” Thank God!!! We launched into a ten minute tirade of who hated it more (I think she did, she came up with so many piercing comments that just shredded the thing) and how touchy it’s been to say anything bad about it because the moment one mentions it, tears and praise start raining down from every corner of the room. Who can put a wet blanket on that? Evidently The Sweetman Women can–I just did.","1 star and I would give it 0 if I could.

I do not usually read classics, but I do not resent them. In my opinion there are a few gems hidden in all those overrated classics that are full of msygonisitic and creepy man. (I look at u Faust!)

Characters

I am MAD. Dracula has the potential to be the most creepy villain and to be truly terrific, but he was not part of a large part of the book. Also he was not creepy at all. I wanted to fall asleep, because my nightmares about failing exams are scarier than those descriptions of vampires.

Jonathan is such a badass. Really, I have never seen such strong, brave CHRISTIAN man, who knows-it-all in a book. He was so annoying and it feels like his chracter was just copied and pasted throughout the whole book just those men all have other names.

The women in this book? No personality, except you count 'being a good, pretty CHRISTIAN girl' as an actual personality trait. I do not understand why they were in this book after all. They did not even advance the plot at all and were written in a way that makes me believe this author never talked to a women at all, if it wasn't for the time it was written in. All the one girls did was to marry and to talk about how much they miss their spouse/husband and how worried they are about them. Besides towards the end it feels like every single man wants to bang the girl Mina, because SHE IS SUCH A GOOD CHRISTIAN GIRL. (just saying, its not very christian to want to bang someone's wife)

PLot

This book has like about 200 pages too many in my opinon. The plot is absolutelty dragged out in so many subplots that were not needed. An entire section about this book was about a women and nothing happened except that she married and killed her off. There were random chapters about Dracula killing people somewhere and random chapters about OUR GOOD CHRISTIAN GIRL MINA, where she does nothing but talk about how much she loves and misses Jonathan. And there is Jonathan, who kinda does nothing the majority of the story and just goes along with the Van Hellsing guy.",Generous,
"now this is a book i'd actually burn.

with a cruel smile playing on my lips, i watch as the merciless flames devour the book, watch as the edges of the pages singe and then turn black, watch as they slowly crumble to ashes which blow away with the wind. i turn around and walk away.

1 star; the characters were flatter than paper + the title always made me hungry :/","I know that this book is extremely popular among female readers, but l have to be frank. Well, l did not like it. I've found it very boring, tedious, dull. It lacks angst which is a very important ingredient for me in books.
I've received a beautiful, expensive, hard cover copy as a present and l was excited, and couldn't wait to read it. Little did l know that it would bore me to tears.
I thought there must be something wrong with me, that l am weird to not like it when everyone else rates it 5 stars.
Oh well...","I don't understand why this book is so over-hyped. I mean what is it that makes this book so great? The story had nothing in it. Half of the book is completely useless, adds nothing to the plot. People like Boo Ridley are there just for the heck of it. There are so many characters and these characters are in no way related to the main story - which just spans for maybe 20 pages?! The aunty, Dill and so many other characters.. why are they even there? What are all the gossiping jobless neighbors doing for more than half of the book? Who cares if a neighbor is good at baking cakes? In what way does she add value to the story? Because of all this gossip, I feel the character about whom I wanted to know more about(the convict) was completely neglected.
One of the most boring books I have ever read. I did not read the last few chapters and just skimmed through. I found the narrator 'Scout' pretty nosy and annoying.","unfortunately i didn’t enjoy this book as much as i hoped. i understand the important qualities and message of this book but it didn’t really resonate with it specifically, i realize i’m one of the very unpopular opinions on this. i found that the story between death and the book thief was odd, leisel barely stole that many books and she was really just a little girl, 10 or 12? and yet i wanted to like this book because it did have an underlying message but it was just too confusing at times and i didn’t really get into the story until halfway through, and i didn’t even have any emotions for the characters until the very end, mostly because of the way it was written, it told you everything that would happen before it happened and i didn’t like that?? death was the narrator i think and it was just very confusing and ominous and i’m sad i didn’t enjoy it, but at least i have it a read.",,,"Unsurprisingly, I can see why so many like-minded idiots adore this book. Everyone wants to believe they are 'special snowflakes' and are above the rest of the average population on an emotional and intellectual level. John Green exploits that in trying to make Hazel anything but the typical teenager with her whole perspective on the ""meaning of life! defeatism! the banality of human spirit! breakfast eggs!"" Too bad Hazel doesn't come off as anything except for whiny, annoying, and eager to prove herself right on the stupidest of topics. (Seriously, eggs?) Hazel's emotional range consisted of angry, disdained, and the occasional angsty-sad. I wouldn't even mind it so much if her way of talking wasn't so off-putting and vomit-inducing. Gus wasn't much better, but then you hardly know anything about him to make much of a judgement. John Green spends too much time waxing purple about ~existential angst and afterlife through the mouths of his characters (topics that make sense I guess, considering it is a Cancer Book) but there wasn't any purpose to it. Really it just showed me (as the reader) how hard he tried to make Hazel and Gus seem like inordinately intelligent teenagers (a concept that is omg so foreign!! teens r stupid duh) Shut up, we get that you're smarter than 80% of the population already. So what?

RELATIONSHIP was not believable in the slightest. No gradual buildup to their love, no evidence that they even cared for each other beyond simple affection and attraction. They're talking casually about poetry one day and BAM! it's ""Hazel I love you"" in a grand, ostentatious speech and I'm left reeling wondering how I missed all the signs. (Newsflash: there are no signs, because the only things their relationship is based on is mutual lust and love for philosophical rants. Also the fact that they're both gonna die pretty soon, which still doesn't provide enough grounds for their ""love."")

John Green tries to distract from the flatness of his characters/their relationship by inserting sarcastic and tryhard witticisms into the dialogue. It didn't work. This book just was not good. It wasn't on a Twilight-terrible scale but it was just BORING. I didn't feel any emotion/empathy for the characters and didn't feel a connection to anyone. Amsterdam might as well have been Venice or any other European city. Hazel and Augustus could've been any two-dimensional hipster off the internet. Of course death sucks but Green trying to pull a cliched slow-death scene to yank a few tears seems like a last-ditch attempt to try and win over the remaining disbelieving readers. After 300-some pages I wanted something to jump out at me, something that would show and not tell me about this supposed epic love story. Nope.


The book jacket states that this is an ""insightful, bold, irreverent, and raw"" book about the ""tragic business of being alive and in love."" Show me the receipts for these claims.","controversial, i know.

chapter 11 of this book went on and on and on about god knows what, i think i gained a wrinkle. oh no, i am now worth nothing","GWTW is a book that, for me, suffers as I get older. My opinions of it have changed through time and openly revising my rating is long overdue.

I first read GWTW when I was in jr. high school and have since read it several times. Like many girls and young women, I got a crush on Rhett Butler with every reading. My younger self admired Scarlett's pluck and resourcefulness, and wished the Civil War had never ruined life on Tara.

Now, I am revolted by GWTW's perspective. It glamorizes the Old South, mourning a lost civilization that was-- at best--morally schizophrenic. Further it reinforces stereotypes and racist delusions.

As literature, this epic story is 1000 pages of chick lit. Now, I like chick lit when it's well written and on this level I admit GWTW is compelling. However, I no longer admire nor can I even tolerate Scarlett. Today, she would be identified as a narcissist with sociopathic tendencies and medicated. I can't even regard GWTW as a love story because Scarlett isn't capable of it.

I am impatient with people who become offended when books of previous generations, accurately reflecting mores of that time, don't fulfill modern sensibilities. However, GWTW doesn't accurately portray the antebellum or Reconstruction South; it quite literally whitewashes it.

So, between GWTW's maudlin, racist perspective and abrasive heroine I'm done with GWTW. And, frankly, I don't give a damn.",,"“Things change. And frienI like it, when contemporary books deal with difficult subjects that don't overtake the story but still make an impact on it. The Perks Of Being A Wallflower does that. But it's told in such an unemotional way, I quite frankly don't give a damn.

A lot of my problems come back to the narration. Charlie our main character is innocent to the point of stupid. And I know that time changed a lot since the book was written and people changed with it, but I just couldn't bring myself to believe in or like Charlie.
I am not a social butterfly. I would say I'm a Wallflower too. Charlie though? As other reviewers pointed out he isn't exactly a wallflower. He made friends instantly. He trusts people instantly. So in that regard I fail to connect with him, despite expectations. He's more clueless than anything else.

Then there's the writing. I hated it. Don't get me wrong, there are some nice quotes in there. But aside from them, the writing is choppy and too simple for my taste. I like diversity and I know that (though I think it wasn't confirmed) Charlie had autism. That gives the writing style an excuse, but even through that I should have felt something, anything for the character. I didn't.

Also, I didn't think I'll ever say this however the amount of abuse in the book was very strange. No, I don't think the world is a place full of rainbows and unicorns. I also don't think abuse is the kind of thing you can only write a sentence about and then forget about it. Every time abuse was mentioned to have happened to somebody, there was barely any actual dealing with it. It was like the book was either trying to be more serious or emotional with throwing random abuse cases in. In my case: I liked it less for it.

Plus there was the fact that the book simply bored me. I didn't like its characters, I didn't get the hype and the story didn't interest me. Not much left to be reading for.

All In All: Was this book for me? No. It's a coming of age story about discovering the world outside your head. In another book, I could have related to that. Sadly, I didn't in here. I liked the movie though.ds leave. Life doesn't stop for anybody.”","I don't like this book. I actually hate the character of Jane. She isn't a courageous heroine, but a meek, subservient little mouse who fails to live up to the promise of her initial ambition and spiky character. She begins her journey striving for independence in the constrained world of Victorian England, overcoming hardships and her lowly standing to achieve a level of autonomy, which she then sacrifices to be with Rochester, not as an equal, but as she began, a servant, a posession.

Rochester is an arrogant, abusive brute, and has virtually no redeeming features to his character. He coldly manipulates Jane, and she clings to him like a weak, soul-less limpet.

Crazy Bertha in the attic and the mystery that surrounds her is by far the most interesting thing in this book, and luckily she gets a whole world of her own in Jean Rhys' Wide Sargasso Sea, a far more entertaining and enjoyable read.","I didn't get very far in this book before I set it down. The premise might have worked out to be interesting, I didn't read enough to know, but the narrative style was extremely annoying. Every page grated on my nerves. I could only endure one chapter.

Also, I felt that the book was very poor at creating dramatic tension. The main character has a confrontation in the first chapter that is told in the most mundane way possible, even though its supposed to be thrilling.",,"Initially I gave this book two stars, but on reflection, I'm deducting one. It's hard to overstate how much I hated this book. I know many people consider it to be the greatest novel ever, but I just can't agree.

The main drawback is the protagonist, Raskolnikov. He's utterly unsympathetic. Leave aside for a moment that he murders an old lady and a developmentally challenged woman (for no real reason). He mopes about for most of the book and in his private thought reveals himself to be resentful and contemptuous of his friends and family. Why do I care about this guy? This intellectual poseur? Spoiler alert: I don't.

This makes it all the more mystifying why his friends and family are so devoted to this lout. I read a ridiculously over-the-top review that describes the other characters as unforgettable and that each speaks with a unique voice. Not really. There's a character called Zametov. Already forgotten who he is and what his connection is to R. And I finished the book two days ago.

R's actions are mystifying and his motivations unexplained. When the book opens, he's pretty much already decided to kill the old woman. Why? I don't know. At first it seems as if it's for money, but then he does a terrible job of stealing her belongings. Then what he does steal, he buries, and it's mostly forgotten. Later, there's a discussion of a sophomoric article that R writes where he's expounded some Nietzschean Great Man of History theory, but R is certainly not worthy of wearing his own mantle.

He encounters Marmeladov, another lout, in a bar. To call his encounter with M casual would be a gross overstatement. His next encounter with Marmeladov is after he's been run over by a horse-drawn carriage (while drunk, but possibly a suicide). After this one, brief encounter, he feels honor bound to give away what little money he has to pay for his funeral and support M's family. Inexplicable.

I know I'm supposed to gush over the universal, human truths espoused by Dostoevsky and talk about how this book changed my life, but I can't. Dostoevsky takes 430 pages to tell a story that could be told in half as many pages. He tells a story about a guy who does a thoughtlessly evil thing for no real reason and supporting characters that are drawn into his orbit for no reason that I can discern.

P.S. Reading some of the other one-star reviews made me feel so much better. Like, yes! I'm not taking crazy pills!","As much as I wanted to at least say I've read this book, I couldn't finish it after reading Geisha of Gion. I guess I'm biased after having heard of what had happened to Mineko Iwasaki as a result of this books publication, but after that Memoirs of a Geisha felt like a sloppy, inaccurate representation of what it means to be a Geisha and a downright betrayal on Golden's part.","One of my least favorite stories. I disliked every character and found the story to be extremely boring. I read this book as a teen, and then again in my forties (thought I might like it better), and still hated it.",,,Sweet home alabama,"While I am a fan of novels with Southern settings, I opted to quickly skim this book after Chapter 1 -- a true rarity for me, especially considering that this is a Vine Voice book I am obligated to review. Perhaps my expectations were too high after reading the synopses and praises heralding it as a ""lush, original"" story told ""through authentic voices..."" I was really looking forward to reading it along with my book buddy, but unfortunately she must proceed without me.

The story's setting is 1962 Mississippi and Aibiliene works as a domestic for white employers. Having lost her only child tragically and unexpectedly, she pours her heart into caring for her white charge (the seventeenth one) as her own. She has a sweet, non-threatening disposition and has seemingly worked diligently, obediently, without protest in the homes of some disrespectful (and I suspect) racist women -- the same women (and their children) that she knows better than they know themselves. The author coats Abiliene's diction with broken English (which is acceptable considering the region and era); but her attempt at the African American vernacular left me a bit frustrated and insulted. She uses a somewhat different choice of words using phonetically yet functionally incorrect substitutes (if there is a literary term for this, I obviously do not know what it is). It may be a nit that bothered only me, but to clarify, here's an example: Law = Lord, a course = of course, spec = expect, and doe-nob = doorknob. This ""pitch perfect voice"" (as described on the back flap) of the the childless, faithful, church-going, make-everything-all-right-for-the-white-folk, black maid -- was a bit too much for me in roughly ten pages. I was sorely disappointed in Aibileen's voice and her story from the onset; I lost interest immediately. I closed the book attempting to flush the stereotypical modern day ""mammy"" image from my mind!

While this review is obviously in the minority, I must rate it low per Amazon's scale -- I did not care for the characters (or their voices) I met and heard in Chapter 1 and could not fathom spending the time and energy reading another 400 detailed pages of it. Maybe I was not the target audience? I am not sure. I finished the book by skimming through the following chapters and sadly there was nothing that I read within the pages to make me reconsider reading the novel in greater detail. Maybe fans of Clara's Heart, The Secret Life of Bees, and other similarly themed works will enjoy this offering. While I did not care for the content and themes, I will note that mechanically the author writes well and is a good storyteller.","I am mad at this book.

It's boring and horrid and slow-paced and it can honestly drive any sane person into a state of catatonic apathy that will never fade away.

First of all, this whole epistolary style thing? Doesn't work. For one, most of the time it's inconceivable that every single character of the story stops in their tracks to write a full-fledged report of what went on in their day, as they're always busy being the worst vampire hunters to ever grace Earth. And secondly,it's stupidly boring and immensely dull and it makes for a more than tedious reading.

What's more, the characters are silly. All the men are portrayed as noble, gallant knights in shining armour just waiting for a damsel in distress that they can save. They're all perfectly nice people with nothing but benevolent thoughts, and their hearts are so filled with goodness one wonders how they haven't yet blown up in an explosion of rainbows. The women, I suppose, are accurately described as they used to think and act back then, all though probably not a hundred percent so, as the book wasn't written by a woman.

Oh, and the most ridiculous of all is that Van Helsing's Dutch accent is carried onto everyone's diary entries of their meetings with him, even though I find it completely daft that someone would take the time to transcript into their diaries every single grammatical error the man made. Also, if he can correctly conjugate ""He is driving"", why is he unable to correctly conjugate ""He drives"", instead of ""He drive""? It's also hard for me to believe that he wouldn't learn the correct conjugation of basic verbs from those around him, since he's deemed to be some sort of genius. I'm just saying.

My last point (out of many I could still make), is that the creature to whom Dracula owes its title isn't scary in the least. Dracula can make himself into a wolf, a bat, and menacingly roiling fog, and yet he's so stupid he manages to actually let himself get caught by a bunch of overemotional passive-aggressive idiots carrying nothing but holy water and some daggers. Like, honestly...

Don't read this book unless it's for school and you absolutely have to for the sake of your GPA. It's not scary, it's not entertaining, and it's the most tedious exercise in purple prose I've ever had to witness.","What a godawful book. It's easy to see the geek appeal of it, though: imagine a fantasy in which the only reason people at school pick on you is because you are so incredibly smarter/better/more wonderful than them and they're just jealous, and the reason authorities are mean is because they recognise your superiority to everyone in the whole world and just want you to be the best. Add to that revenge fantasies in which you violently kill the kids at school who don't like you (but it's not your fault, you are sensitive and compassionate, they just wouldn't leave you alone) while the adults are just *pretending* they don't like you, and when you're asleep they creep into your room to secretly tell you how much they love you. And then you get to save the whole world through your intrinsic wonderfulness.

I can see the appeal, all right, but it's a socially and emotionally crippled worldview, and makes a stunted, ugly little book.

The plot itself is hopelessly Z-grade - the only protection against a race of aliens is a little six-year-old geek and his friends. Adult authority is forced to beg a little kid to save the world, by playing video games. Also, his brother and sister, also kids, are literally taking over the world through blogging. At first it's kind of gripping as torture porn, as Ender is picked on again and again and it's just totally not his fault, but the unrelenting pattern (Ender is picked on, then Ender proves to everyone he is awesome sauce, optionally beating another child to death along the way) just becomes incredibly tedious, especially as Ender is too perfect to be allowed even minor failures. Even the enemy aliens are forced to adore him - after all, there's only three choices: die horribly for not liking him, worship him, or both.

It doesn't help that the writing is clunky, tell-don't-showy, and just plain bad. My favourite example of terrible writing was ""His face went angry"", but another example is Gary Stu's sister Mary Sue - we're told over and over how eloquent and what a wonderful writer she is, but we don't see a single example except one poorly written letter. We're told their brother is literally a murderer and a jackal at heart, but except for one squirrel, he doesn't do much more scary than pick on his little brother, make childish ""I kill you!"" threats to his siblings, and argue with people on the internet. Don't worry, though,. Card won't make you make your own mind up about them, or Ender, or anyone else - he'll tell you what to think, over and over.

And oh, the writing of the children makes me think that Card had never actually met an actual child, let alone a gifted one. The way he writes six-year-olds speaking and socialising is just bizarre, as if they were aliens, or written by an alien. But then. I guess Ender was never really a six year old at all. He's a geeky adolescent living out power fantasies.",
