"Larson could be the worst nonfiction writer working in America today. When he notes that ""[Frederick Law] Olmsted was no literary stylist. Sentences wandered through the report like morning glory through the pickets of a fence"" he might as well be describing himself. It's painful to make your way through his books. The melodrama is over the top. He'll go on for several pages about some unnamed person, attempting to heighten the ""mystery,"" and anyone who graduated second grade will quickly realize he's talking about the inventor of the Ferris Wheel. But only several chapters later - in the manner of Nancy Drew abruptly tumbling to the bottom of a dark well - he'll have the mystery man dramatically sign his name to a letter: George Washington Gale Ferris. George Washington Gale Ferris !!!!!!!! I did not see that coming.

His narrative is peppered with the most insignificant, totally unrelated factoids, I suppose because they amused him and he couldn't stand the thought of leaving them out. He loves nothing more than to set a scene - so and so in a Pullman car or a fine dining club, this and that person on an ocean liner, attempting to send a cable to someone on the Titanic - merely in order to convey some piece of information totally unrelated to the wholly gratuitous scene. As to historical accuracy, doubtless there's a fair bit; he does have lots of end notes, and he consulted many historical sources. But he also embellishes novelistically in a way that no real historian would ever allow himself to do. It's shameful, and shameless. He asserts in the text that such and such happened, but if you check the endnotes, it didn't really happen - but it could have, he says. It was likely, he felt. After reading Isaac's Storm, which was also heavily embellished and the endnotes similarly acknowledging such, I don't trust anything this man writes. I wash my hands of him.","This was an interesting book. I say it was interesting because I started liking it (a lot) when I first read it, as time passed I liked it less and less. In that way I call it a candy book, tastes good at first but leaves you worse off for reading it.

In my opinion, there are two problems with the book: First, Stephen Dubner comes across as a sycophant. Way to much of the book is spent praising Levitt. Secondly, I was disappointed in the lack of detail provided about Livitt's hypothesis. I wanted more. It was like reading War and Peace and discovering that you read the abridged version and in fact the book wasn't 100 pages long. This disappointment may have come from my engineering background and my strong desire to really understand economics. This book didn't offer any of that, only a titillating glimpse of the economics.

In some regards one may think my single start rating is to harsh. As mind candy this book was quite good. I did enjoy reading it at the time. Whats more, it did encourage me to study real economics. I am currently enrolled in a masters program in economics and this book did play a very small roll in that decision process. However, as I learn more about economics I realize how shallow the book in fact was.

While this is not the forum for a comprehensive review of the topics presented in the book, or an analysis of how good the economics in Freekanomics are, a review in ""Journal of Economic Literature (Vol XLV, Dec. 2007 pp 973)"" quotes Livitt as saying: ""There is no question I have written some ridiculous papers."" The article then goes on to quote a paper by Noam Scheibler(2007) describing Livitt's comparing some of his papers to the fashion industry. ""Sometimes you write papers and they're less about the actual result, more about your vision of how you think the profession should be. And so I think some of my most ridiculous papers actually fall in the high-fashion category.""","Oh my gods, what a waste of perfectly good paper! I am flabbergasted that this has such consistently high reviews...

Three problems with this tripe:
1. falsity of the science (most blatantly around cosmology, but not limited to any one field) and misunderstanding of scientific principles;
2. a focus more on ""biography"" rather than on real ""history"";
3. trivial worthlessness of the information.

Number 1 is briefly chronicled below. Within just the first 20 pages or so, there are ridiculous factual errors and misrepresentations of scientific knowledge. Even in 2003 when the book was published, these errors would have been unforgivable. Where the bloody hell were the editors?! Apparently the author came out later to mention his ""lack of scientific chops,"" or the like. How can a book about the history of science fuck up the science?!

Number 2 is just downright sad. Apparently the author felt that if he could spend about a page per scientist, he would make the material more interesting. No, man, I want science and history, not abbreviated and hackneyed biography. He doesn't even move smoothly between people... it's just a meandering of random scientific endeavors, somewhat brought into chronology.

Number 3 is a difficult criticism, because with this kind of book, it is hard to get away from misc. trivia. And I'll even acknowledge that I learned a lot of trivia... and that the book does a great job of showing us just how much we don't know. But as I reached page 360 and realized (for the fifth or so time) that this was info that I could get in a quick google search, I just couldn't do it anymore.

What a gods awful waste. What's more disappointing than the book though, is the overwhelming praise the book has gotten. I don't even want to sell this book back, but throw it away (and I thought I would never say something like that)! I'd rather have someone go slightly ignorant than have them be fed this mess of misinformation and dredge.",,,,,"This is what happens when you take an intelligent person, and casually make a few mentions of a field of study they have no knowledge of.

Mr. Diamond, NOT an anthropologist, takes Marvin Harris' theory of cultural materialism and uses it to explain everything in life, history, and the current state of the world.

Materialism is a way of looking at human culture which, for lack of a better way to explain it easily here, says that people's material needs and goods determine behavior and culture. For instance Jews stopped eating pigs because it became so costly to feed pigs they themselves were starving.

On the surface, materialism seems very logical. Like any theory it has to be at least somewhat probable sounding, and since people are used to thinking of life, these days, in terms of materialistic values already, Harris' theory sounds logical and likely very often.

But like every other time you attempt to explain everything that ever happened in the history of man with one theory, this falls desperately short of reality. Materialism is likely ONLY when coupled, sensibly, with other theories and, need I say it, actual PROOF, of which Diamond has little.

As an exercise in materialist theory this book is magnificent. I would recommend this book ONLY to people in Anthropology with a great understanding of theory, less educated or unwarned people might think this book is fact rather than an exercise in speculation.

As an explanation of why the world is the way it is, it is an utter and complete failure.","Malcolm Gladwell writes very interesting and entertaining books. J.R.R. Tolkein writes very interesting and entertaining books as well. However, after reading Tolkein, I did not venture out into the world in search of hobbits, dwarves and elves to be my new friends, or worry about being attacked by trolls. Tolkein's books, while entertaining, have little connection to reality. Unfortunately, the same can be said about Gladwell. ""Outliers"" is a series of well-written and interesting essays along the lines of New Yorker or Vanity Fair articles. However, their connection with reality is highly, highly dubious.

This book is a big disappointment after ""The Tipping Point"" and ""Blink"", both interesting books that don't have the reader arguing with the author the entire way through. One main problem is that there isn't really an identifiable thesis in the book. It seems like Gladwell wants to say that the myth of the ""self-made"" person is not true, since every successful person has had help and lucky breaks along the way. Well, duh! But then he goes on to say that successful people spend 10,000 hours on their chosen area of success. Do they get any credit for that? Does working on something for 10,000 hours when you could be goofing off make you a bit ""self-made""? In my book it certainly does.

Take Bill Gates. Yes, he came from a rich family, had some breaks and some unique opportunities. But what about his former classmates who are now meth addicts or bitter failures who had similar opportunities, but didn't sieze them? Or those who simply were too lazy to put in 10,000 hours in front of the computer? Is Gates ""lucky"" that he had the drive to do that? So either the main thesis falls apart -- that if you are privileged and lucky you will be successful, or it becomes something completely prosaic, such as ""Gates worked hard, but he had some unique breaks"". Again, duh! That's life. Every person can identify positives and negatives in their own lives. It is the choice to overcome the negatives and to capitalize on the positives that makes the difference. If Gates hadn't found the computer lab Gladwell discusses, would he have just given up, or would he have kept on looking? I think that he would have kept looking until he found a similar opportunity.

The science is also incredibly flimsy. He asserts - ""Successful hockey players are almost all born in January - March"". Well, wouldn't that apply to all athletes? Wouldn't somebody before Gladwell have figured that out? Where is the data from the NBA, NHL, NFL and MLB? It really is an example of inductive reasoning, not good science. Gladwell is made aware of a pattern with *certain* hockey teams in Canada, and then assumes that this small sample proves that if you are born in April or after, you won't become a good athlete. Maybe so, but Gladwell needs more data to prove his point.

Another assertion is: ""Asians are good at math because their ancestors were rice farmers - They come from a patient, hard-working culture"". But perhaps there are other reasons that could explain the same thing: religious traditions, government, how education is structured. Hey, maybe Asians have a high tolerance for their own body odor and can spend more hours in the field than Europeans! I'm not seriously arguing that, but it is an example of Gladwell making a connection between two things that is far from proven.

The book is best read as a series of colorful essays on some interesting topics. However, as a guide or explanation of success, it is an example of truly sloppy science and shoddy reasoning. True, successful people don't get there on their own. But everyone can review their lives and identify lucky breaks as well as unfair disadvantages. In the end, Gladwell doesn't explain success at all in a convincing fashion, and risks leaving the reader with the impression that fatalism is the only attitude to have towards their own success. Nothing could be further from the truth.",,This used to be one of my favorite books until I learned Mr. Wiesel admitted to having falsified most of it. Disappointing revelation.,"This book irritated me from the beginning. It couldn't decide if it was a history of the cells, the life story of one woman, a chronicle of how an author tracks down the life story of a woman, a position paper on racism, a position paper on human tissue ownership, or a position paper on disorganized rhetoric.

I think it was all of those, and it drove me absolutely up the wall.

As a history of the HeLa cells ... I read a Wired article that was better.
As the life story of Henrietta Lacks ... it read like a list of facts instead of a human interest piece. And it kept going on tangents (with the life stories of each of her children, her doctors, etc.)
As the story of the author tracking down a story ... that was actually kind of interesting.
As a position paper on racism...it had a lot of disturbing stories - but no cohesive point.
As a position paper on human tissue ownership... the best chapter was the last one, which actually listed facts and laws. And while the author clearly had an opinion in that chapter -it was more focused and less full of unrelated stories intended to pull on your hearts strings and shift your opinion.
As a position paper on disorganized rhetoric...it was a stellar exemplar.",,,"Dry. Reading this book is like eating saltine crackers without anything to drink. He only briefly discusses the cases (these are, ahem, the interesting parts of the book) and then embarks on tedious philosophical discussions about neurology. He does seem very proud of himself and his education, though; I will give him that as a backhanded compliment.","After reading this book, pen in hand, my copy was so marked up with scrawls and underlining that there might have been a second book written in the margins. I wish I could say it was praise for the author's insight into the Columbine tragedy, but instead it was sheer incredulity at the number of mistakes, lies, and misperceptions Cullen is trying to pass off as truth. If your only exposure to Columbine was watching it unfold live on tv, and then maybe reading a few magazine articles, you will probably rate this book five stars.

But if you've spent years studying Columbine and other school shootings, if you've read the 12,000+ documents available online (including the witness interviews and the the shooters' journals) you be able to understand how Cullen seems to be deliberately twisting the truth in order to present a neat little explanation that lets nearly everyone off the hook and lets us all feel good about our schools and our society. This entire book is filled with little but speculation, stated as fact, often with nothing whatever to back it up, or to explain why he comes to those conclusions.

Some of the mistakes are minor, such as the tidbit that all the school shooters during the years 1997-1998 were 'white boys'. Most mistakes were a great deal less minor, such as Cullen's repeated assertion that Eric Harris ""Got chicks. Lots and lots of chicks"", he ""had scored with a 23 year old when he was only seventeen"" and he ""outscored much of the football team"". Yet, according to Cullen (and Eric's own journal) Eric died a virgin. Cullen goes on and on about those 'chicks', stamping in his own idea that Eric was hugely popular at Columbine, yet he never manages to explain why, if that was the case, Eric was completely unable to ""get any"". A better explanation, and one that fits the interviews with those who actually attended Columbine, was that Eric was *not* ""ranked just under the football team"" in popularity, but was actually near the bottom as far as the pecking order of High School. Another example is where Cullen claims that Eric didn't know that he had been rejected by the Marine recruiter (for being on the drug Luvox). Not only was Eric in the room, when the recruiter said that Luvox ""would be a problem"" and that Eric ""would have to have been off the drug a year before he would join"", but Eric also told several of his friends that he had been rejected. Cullen says Eric ""had no interest in the Marines"", but Eric's journal tells another story: ""I would have been a great Marine, it would have given me a chance to be good"".

Cullen says ""there's no evidence that bullying led to murder"". He says that ""Neither [Eric or Dylan:] complained about bullies picking on them"". This is a completely false assertion. There are many, many eyewitness accounts of them being bullied, there is a video of Dylan being slammed into a locker, and there is this statement, straight from Eric's journal: ""Everyone is always making fun of me because of how I look, how **ing weak I am and **, well I will get you all back: ultimate *%ing revenge here."" During the shooting, they tell everyone wearing white hats to stand up. Cullen gives this quote, but never bothers to explain that it was the jocks who wore white hats at Columbine. He also leaves out the fact that both boys told victims during the shooting that ""this was for all the &*#* you put us through"".

Cullen wants us to believe that Eric was simply a psychopath, and that Dylan was his unwilling dupe, despite the fact that IF Eric was (and that's a huge if, since there is too many arguments for him not being a psychopath to list here), it doesn't explain WHY he was a psychopath. He certainly didn't show signs of Juvenile Conduct Disorder growing up, as psychopaths nearly invariably do. By all accounts, Eric was a normal kid, in the beginning. He didn't torture animals or show any other warning signs of a sadistic temperament, according to his friends, teachers, and neighbors. And contrary to the movies, psychopaths are nearly always non-violent and not suicidal. Something happened to Eric and Dylan to make them the way they died. To act out in violent revenge, a person doesn't have to be ""psyopathic"", he only has to be made to feel as if he is completely worthless, and to have all hope taken away from him. Bullying does this. And at this point, a child will either turn the anger and despair in on himself and commit suicide (as the 11 year old boy did recently) or else, like Eric Harris, he will turn it outward. To say, as Cullen does, that Eric's behavior was a mere accident of birth is to deny everything that we could learn from Columbine. It makes us close our eyes to how we can help other children trapped in this downward spiral of bullying and prevent more violence.

If Cullen intended to ""bust the myths of Columbine"" by ignoring everything that didn't fit his theory, he did an excellent job, and this book deserves a full five stars. I just feel sorry that for many people, this will be the ""truth"" they come away believing in. The thirteen who died in Littleton deserve a better memorial than this book.","Charles Manson is the one of the most tedious and unimportant figures in history. His racism, his misogyny, his hatred of everyone more successful than him, his opportunism, his lust for violence - none of these were original. All he did was read between the lines of mainstream American society and reflected it back in a more direct, unrepressed form.

One of the great problems with this book, therefore, is that it refuses to see the extent to which Manson was, in repeating the evils of the system back to itself, a kind of perverse critique. Yes, he was an evil murderer who only cared about himself, but what kind of society would produce such a monster? The author, Vincent Bugliosi, never turns the lens around to look at himself or the world he inhabits to see the source of Manson's evil. There is a dogged conservatism to Bugliosi's narrative that refuses to see this truth.

While that is my main problem with this book, it is not the only one. For a start, it is unnecessarily long. Bugliosi was the prosecutor on the Manson case, and he gives us everything excruciating twist and turn of the legal trial, whether it is of interest or not (mostly not). What is more, Bugliosi clearly has a massive ego, for he constantly makes himself the hero of the story, showing up the incompetence of the police and wrestling with perceived legal injustices and tricks that might have allowed Manson to go free.

I am sure there are better books on Manson out there, but despite its bestseller status, this one simply does not pass the test of time.",,,"My reading at the time was an enlightenment into the damage that the use of chemicals had been doing to our environment. Today, however, Carson be considered the ""Margaret Mead"" of environmental science. Like Mead, much what Carson wrote was concocted factoids rather than scientific observation, meant to support a chosen viewpoint. However, where Mead presented a romantic view of primitive society that did no harm to them and little to the rest of us, Carson must be held at least partially accountable for the deaths of 20 million African women and children who died needlessly because of the exaggerated fears she and others created about the use of DDT. Today, we (at least most of us) view the use of insecticides rationally in terms of protecting health, but we still honor Carson's irrationality - it was well-meant, after all.","This was the most painful book I have read this summer. I choked it down like bad medicine page after page. Quiet is great self affirmation for someone who considers themselves an introvert, and sees humans as either an extrovert or introvert. Cain certainly thinks she’s the poster child of an introvert, or is she? The book reads like a memoir in parts where she tells stories of her own life, then there are smatterings or small examples in specific parts of people’s lives of how greatness comes in quiet e.g. Steve Wozniak, Gandhi, Rosa Parks.

Cain also fancies herself a bit of a child psychologist, on one hand it’s ok for kids to be shy or in their shell, these aren’t bad things, and very normal, but on the other hand we need to nudge and push slowly to get kids out of their quiet place. So which is it?

It doesn’t bother me that Cain isn’t a psychologist or economist, but she’s talking through both sides of her mouth, the book is a pity party, she thinks the decisions in modern workplaces are influenced by highly extroverted personalities like those from the Harvard Business School. There’s no backing for this other than the fact that business students are extroverts. Additionally the economic crisis was wholly the fault of extroverts, basically extroverts with their loud voices overpowered the brilliant quiet hardworking, and smart introverts and ran the economy to the ground. I’m afraid you really aren’t brilliant if something has already happened and you didn’t do anything to stop it. In hindsight everything is 20/20, just because you are quiet and something bad is happening saying “I knew it!” doesn’t do much.

The circlejerk continues when Cain bangs on about everyone who a douche as being an extrovert. Good guys are introverts, Warren Buffet because of his one speech about the dot com bubble bursting was quiet and well calculated in his words. The rest of the word are greedy businessmen. There’s some sample or thin slicing in her discussions that I find problematic, and read a bit like a tabloid.

Susan Cain is clearly appealing to an audience that is already sold to introversion, and stroking those egos. I wish the book had more solutions instead of harping about how bad people are. The book blurs it’s lines through many genres, self help, psychology and a dash of group-think. I consider myself an introvert, but also an extrovert, yes I do believe brilliance happens in unaccompanied activities like running. I charge my batteries during times like this but I also don’t “suffer in silence”. I don’t believe people are fully introverted or extroverted.

Reading Khaneman’s Thinking Fast and Slow and Mcgonigal’s Willpower Instinct make Cain’s book look hurriedly and thoughtlessly written, there’s little appeal to science.",,,"I hated, hated, HATED this book! Talk about literary elitism at its worst. This book annoyed me to no end because the entire tone of this book was, ""If you write like this or if you say this, then it's wrong."" So much of what was written in the ""Improperly used words"" section could be completely argued that language has evolved to the point where many of these rules don't apply anymore. I also didn't like the imperative manner in which it was written. Don't order me to do these things; give me encouragement, tell me what's good about writing, don't just tell me what not to do.

The last chapter of the book was much more positive, and I think that's because it was written by E.B. White. I could totally tell where one voice began and the other ended.

I guess what really upsets me most about this book is how discouraging it can be for beginning writers to see so many nit-picky ""rules"" of writing and find themselves saying, ""Why bother?"" For people who enjoy writing, maybe this book might be of some use as a way to give you ""friendly reminders,"" but I fear beginning writers getting a hold of this book, saying, ""Writing has way too many rules,"" and then giving up before they even try.

I have many other writing books in my collection that are written with voice and flow, and are inspirational rather than enraging. (e.g. In the Middle by Nancie Atwell, Clearing the Way and Crafting Authentic Voice by Tom Romano, The Craft of Revision by Donald M. Murray, Style: Toward Clarity and Grace by Joseph M. Williams, etc.) I think I will continue to refer to those books rather than this one."
"I feel greatly deceived. This book is titled The Devil in the White City. It is shelved as true crime. Less than half of this book is actually about H. H. Holmes. The majority is about Burnham and the building of the Chicago World's Fair.

The book itself was fine but I picked it up for my interest in serial killers and HHHolmes specifically so I was extremely disappointed in it. I found myself skimming or altogether skipping many sections about the fair. Especially Olmstead's sections were grueling. His chapters were painful treks through melancholy, illness, indecision, and general crybaby-ness.

The sections that were actually about the books namesake, the devil in the white city, were abbreviated, leaving much to foreshadowing and the reader's imagination.

If you are interested in this book because of a fascination with serial killers or HHHolmes, steer clear; more information can be found on the internet in less than 5 minutes of reading than is contained in this 400 page volume.","Jesus H Tittyfucking Christ on a bike!

I really loved Walk in the Woods..I loved his witty banter and his engaging, story-telling writing style. I'm not sure WHO, if anyone, would actually enjoy this bland book. I love science and history, but this was just excruciating and mind-numbingly boring and tedious. I ended up skimming most of it. Life is too short for boring books!",,,,,"This may be the most over-rated book in the history of book rating. The point he is making is that we in Western Civilazation haven't built skyscrapers, made moon landings, mass produced automobiles, eradicated polio (or for that matter lived indoors with running water) while aborigines in certain remote outposts still hunt and gather in isolated tribes because we are inherently any smarter or more industrious than those individuals.

This immortal cell line was derived from Mrs. Lacks' cervical tissue, which became cancerous after she was infected with HPV. She recieved treatment for cervical canver at Johns Hopkins University, known at this time period for treating black patients.

Though I don't know how her race/ethnicity/social status affected her personal treatment at the hospital, the actual medical treatment for her condition was unbiased and the normal protocol for any one with the condition.

During this time period, research physicians, or physicians who were interetsed in biomedical research were striving to culture an immortal cell line, which has enormous applications and implications in biomedical research. The physicians, with the help of other scientists and technicians, were able to create a cell line that had greatly sought-after conditions for the purposes of biomedical research, inlcuding immortalization and ease of growth in culture. The use of her cells greatly impacted the field of biomedical research, and the cultivation and use of the HeLA cell line contributed to the establishment of the first Polio vaccine, cancer research, and countless other types of research where the characteristics of the HeLa cell line offer great advatange and resource for pusuit of scientific knowledge.

My review of this book has nothing to do with the contributions her cells have made to the scientific community. The physicians at the time did take her cells and culture them without her consent, but that was standard protocol at the time, and she was not isolated for that purpose. We have all contributed from the use of her cells, therefore, it is hypocritical to be critical of the use of them.

Despite a major attempt to create a ""boogey-man"" portrait of the physicians/scientists that worked with her cells, none of them were awarded financially for establishing the HeLa cell line. The author tries to create an image of a poor black woman who was robbed of her cells without consent and not awarded the enormous monentary prize for their use, but the truth is, this was standard procedure at that time period,and her cells just happened to actually work for that purpose.


I was very interested to learn more about Mrs. Lacks in this book. What made this book impossible to read was the author. She hardly writes more than a few pages about Mrs. Lacks. She mostly wrote a biography detailing her attempts at finding information, without providing anything insightful about the actual woman it was supposed to be about, Mrs. Lacks.

Most of the book is about her relatives and their immense anger and resentment about not being compensated for the use of Mrs. Lacks' cells. I don't really give a shit about that. A lot of shitty things happen to people in this world, this wasn't in any way the worst, and that would have made a decent book if that was what the book was supposed to be about.

This book was so boring, I didn't even finish it.",,,"It is very unusual for me not to finish a book.
I really thought I would have enjoyed this - a book of case studies from the field of neurology. The cases in and of themselves are fascinating, losses of memory and phantom limbs, stories of trial through adversity and considerations of what it means to be human. However....the telling of these stories is so cumbersome, loaded down with a lot of medical jargon and repetitive philosophical discourse. Some stories feel oddly attenuated - a quick survey of a case, no more than a few pages and then onto the next patient ...In addition I think this book, written in the 80s, is showing signs of it's age - I am pretty sure some of the terms used for patients would no longer be acceptable and something about the discussion of peoples souls seemed out of place in a book of science.

Everything else was a big, rambling mess, written at a 4th grade level. Sadly, I see that Joan Walsh (Cullen's editor or publisher at Salon) can be blamed for encouraging him.

""Dylan was in pain. Nobody got it. Vodka helped. The Internet did, too. Girls were hard to talk to; Instant Messaging made it easier....
IMs were not enough. Too many secrets to hold on to; too many concepts zipping over their heads.""

""Girls were fighting for the chance to date [Patrick Ireland:], so he got tired of waiting and asked one out. Then he asked another one. And another - this was fun!""

""Bomb scares at Columbine spiked. The school was evacuated a few days later. Moms felt their muscles clench, bracing for the terrifying news.""","I read this ages ago, and I'm not going to read it again, so I'll just share my impression from the time: Self-congratulatory and tedious.",,,"This is a book of flawed arguments and unsubstantiated B.S. which has destroyed more lives than it saves.

I agree with the basic premise of the book -- that the world is skewed toward extroverts and that introverted qualities are needed and even superior in some situations. It's just a shame that the author couldn't articulate those strengths without insulting extroversion at every turn. I lost count of how many times in the first 60 pages she refers to extroverts as ""loudmouths."" I also questioned whether she understands the concepts of extroversion and introversion because she spends an inordinate of time talking about lots of things that had me asking, ""What does this have to do with introversion?"" For example, throughout the book, Cain confuses introversion with shyness, even though she admits the research shows they are not the same. The author also rather dramatically misinterprets some important research to support her points. Oddly, she tells a long story about meeting the researcher (Jerome Kagan), somewhat admits that she is misappropriating his work, and then continues to do so.

Finally, Cain paints a picture of extroversion that I simply don't recognize in myself or most others I know. For example, she spends a lot of time talking about how much we love and are good at public speaking. (Huh? Is she familiar with the studies where people commonly cite public speaking as more feared than death? Yes, she is. Does that matter? Apparently not.) To prove this point, she goes to a Tony Robbins motivational event that sounds, honestly, like a cult that would have me sprinting for the parking lot. I believe my exact words were, ""THAT'S what you think extroversion is and that's where you go to try to understand it?!?"" I could go on, but suffice to say I gave up the first time at 60 pages, at the encouragement of my husband who got tired of me talking to (OK, sometimes yelling at) my e-reader. I gave up again at page 122 for good. This book could have been so much more. What a disappointment.",,,"I thought I'd just take a moment to say this book is stupid. It doesn't contain any of the grammatical errors/ rules that I would tend to forget, and only includes a bunch of ones I already know. It is overrated.

I would like to know why it is so successful, and has inspired so many spinoffs. If you type ""the elements of style"" you get this whole list of versions of the same idea, all purporting to strip a field down to its barest essentials- of design, of fonts, of java (a computer language), of screenwriting.

I'd also like a book that would teach me little known but relevant grammar rules. For example, I have never really found a clear explanation for the difference between ""like"" and ""as"" and ""such as,"" etc."
"I. COULD. NOT. GET. INTO. THIS. BOOK.

I tried. I tried again. Nope. Nada.
I am the outlier. I acknowledge that fact. However, my review must reflect how I see it.

The architectural aspect of building the Chicago World's Fair was just too much of a laborious read:
too wordy,
too tedious,
too many characters,
too many extraneous and non-essential details,
too much boring dialogue.

The serial killer at The World's Fair was the parallel plot, but MUCH ( if not most) of the narrator's perspective was fictionalized. The serial killer portion was not documented and, therefore, not reliable or compelling AT ALL.

I was so disappointed I did not like it. It is NOT in the true crime genre. DNF","I lost all faith in this book when it tried to teach you how to be a “perfect parent” and came to the conclusion that “it isn’t so much a matter of what you do as a parent; it’s who you are.” He claims that your socioeconomic status determines whether or not you will be a good parent. One of his biggest points in this chapter is that nothing a parent does (for example, taking their child to museums or reading books to their toddler) matters in the slightest. The only data he uses to draw this conclusion is a collection of test scores. Obviously a high test score does not equal a well-raised, happy child in a healthy family environment. And of course what you do as a parent matters. You can’t totally neglect your child and then claim you’re a perfect parent because of your socioeconomic status. You also cannot determine what makes a good parent based on children’s test scores alone.

Also, can we talk about how self-congratulatory the author is? It makes the book such a chore to read when he includes things like how he is a demigod of economics or how much he dazzled journalists with his inventiveness and how he revolutionized the field.

Freakonomics is disappointing.","The ego of modern physical scientists is annoying. The first 3/4ths of this book explains why/how scientists of the past were wrong, ignorant or foolish. The last 1/4th of the book is dedicated to extolling the absolute correctness and superior understanding of modern scientists. Does he not see the irony? As always happens in science, centuries to come will look back upon current belief and see it as elementary and simplistic. Especially in the physical sciences. The hubris of this author (and the people he speaks about) is obnoxious. Consider the current debates among physicists. There is much speculation and theorizing involving quantum theory... which is the very basic component of existence. If even they can't agree then where does Bryson get off acting like he is omniscient? I would have liked this book if it weren't for the smug turn it took at the end. ""They were wrong... they were foolish.... they didn't know what they were talking about... WE'RE RIGHT!!!"" BAH! Idiot.",,,,,"I will say this: he makes some interesting points about geographical and geological determinism and the potential validity thereof. Everything else, however, is basically shit. The Pulitzer this book got must have been the world's biggest and most expensive A for effort.

Diamond writes in his introduction that a multi-discipline effort ""would be doomed from the outset, because the essence of the problem is to develop a unified synthesis. That consideration dictates single authorship, despite all the difficulties it poses."" He does go on to mention ""guidance from many colleagues,"" but even so this makes no goddamn sense (p. 26). It is actually possible to find people across disciplines who agree on a single theory - like, say, gravity. I'm using theory in the scientific sense here, where the fact of gravity's existence is obvious but there needs to be a framework of mechanical explanation - and this framework has the potential to be proven wrong. That doesn't change the fact of gravity's existence, it just means that one person's (or several people's) proposed explanation of its mechanics was misconceived. You can see similar approaches in the field of history. What this boils down to is, Diamond is saying right in the bloody introduction to the whole book that he was the only one who could do this glorious project and he didn't want to bring other people in because they might not agree with every single thing he's saying. GOD FORBID.

This book would have benefited from multiple authorship, particularly a partnership with someone who had some actual experience with historical research and thinking, because the incessant lazy errors are impressively offensive - Diamond keeps predicating his argument on such and such historical facts, but the facts he's using are flawed and wrong. Take his chapter on the Spanish invasion of the Americas. First off, he calls the indigenous naive like the extinct megafauna of the previous chapter - I'm not kidding, he uses that exact word and that exact comparison to animals; for somebody who's so avowedly anti-racist that's a fucking awful rhetorical tactic - but the academic offense is that his primary sources for the capture of Inca leader Atahuallapa are, as far as I can tell, Spanish letters to the king and Spanish personal journals. That's it. (Nothing is properly cited in this book, which is another cringe point.) Even a high school student could tell you that you should use and cite primary sources from multiple sides of an event, cite your secondary sources, and use some goddamn critical thinking. If you look at the Inca sources, sure there's some conflicting accounts - same goes for the Spanish - but what's obvious is that they weren't naive. Diamond asserts that Atahuallpa had bad information and it was an obvious trap supported by the advantages of Spanish literacy, but if you look at all the sources the situation is more that he had the right information but chose to be diplomatic in the Incan tradition. Pizarro was just a dick. (Diamond is right about the significance of germs, but that part's a gimme.)

There are a lot of fundamentally flawed arguments like that - e.g. pre-invasion indigenous people on the coast of Australia being described as totally isolated even though the historical record shows them as being brilliant sailors and the numerous islands between Australia and the Asian mainland are reachable by walking in places, or talking about the easy dispersal of animals/crops across a continental ""axis"" of north/south or east/west despite huge mountain ranges and climate differences across the terrain like in Asia - and his broader assertions are also seriously problematic. Like when he's discussing the supposed advantages of the written word (completely dismissive of pictographs and no mention of signed languages, of course) he name-checks Chinese and Japanese but otherwise devotes his syllabic-complexity argument to Roman-alphabet languages. Which, no. Focusing on the languages that are easiest for you to understand is far from persuasive. (To say nothing of the historical errors in that chapter as well.) And then there's smaller things like the series of photographs of people, all not white and mostly wearing indigenous clothing and unsmiling expressions, which is totally unnecessary - if Diamond's ""objection to such racist explanations [of sociocultural differences vis-a-vis a western capitalist definition of success] are is not just that they are loathsome, but also that they are wrong,"" then what the fuck are these pictures doing in here (p. 19)? Why does it matter what these oh so poor, less successful people look like? Jesus christ.

I could go on and discuss the further problem of his trying to fit history into a science framework, when the two have different approaches for a reason - which is, of course, not to say that the philosophies and conclusions of one can't support the other - but I think the point of Diamond's colossal hubris and scholarly failure has been sufficiently made for this review. (There are critical essays by people more professionally accomplished and generally articulate than myself out there.)","The book ""Outliers: A Story of Success"" by Malcolm Gladwell was about how to become successful and tells other peoples' stories of success. It also tells you your odds of becoming successful and goes over some unfortunate stories of peoples' failed success.

My favorite part about this book was learning why Asians are good at math. My least favorite part was that he really dragged on. He had few counter-arguments and his book was more persuasive than factual. He only told us one side of the story and dragged on for about 50 pages saying the exact thing over and over again. He also made it look like you had to be a certain way or be raised a certain way in order to achieve success. We all know many people who are successful that go against what he is saying and I think that it is unprofessional to say that you have no chance at success just because you were born too late in the year or weren't raised as a Jew.

I would only recommend this book to people who like books that drag on and have no counter-arguments. I would also recommend this book to Jewish-Asians born between January and March because they will feel very confident with their future.",,"Night is a book that is given more credit than it deserves simply because it is about the holocaust. In my opinion it was a book written by a man with a broken heart who wishes to transfer all of his pain to his readers. His book talks about nothing but pain, suffering, and his lack of forgiveness! There are much better books that talk about the holocaust but also talk about the forgiveness and grace that allow survivors to move on. I recommend The Hiding Place as an alternative to this monstrosity.","I teach an Introduction to Clinical Medicine course in a medical school and this book was a summer reading assignment. The class spent last Wednesday discussing and debating the book and I was grateful to discover that many of the students in the class felt the same way I did - they really disliked this book. I've summarized many of the reasons why the students and I developed such strongly negative opinions of ""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"" here:

1. The author has created a mythology. By referring to Henrietta somehow being ""alive"" is falacious. The cells are not Henrietta - in fact they are the opposite of Henrietta. The cells are anti-Henrietta and are what actually killed her. Do you cry and worry over the hair that's left on the floor of a barbershop after a haircut? How about your nail clippings? What about baby teeth or a wart that is burned off? What is,the difference between any of these things and Henrietta's cells? The family were uneducated and superstitious and to continuously refer to the cells and somehow ""being"" Henrietta was a confusing and cruel fantasy.

2. Why did the author inject herself into the story? Is that what historical biographers are supposed to do? Frankly, the only part of the book that isn't salacious, pandering, Jerry Springer-level anthropology is the 13 page Afterword, which is actually a well-written and thought-provoking essay. Now Ms. Skloot is forever linked to this pseudo-story, not as an objective observer but as a character in her own fevered imagination. It is a tremendous effort at self-promotion and glory-seeking which throws a dark shadow over the believability of any of the events of the story.

3. The author creates many 2-dimensional characters that are either all good or all bad. Cases in point- the elderly couple with the Confederate flags in the living room, Galen the sexual-predator uncle and Christoph, the noble and sympathetic scientist.

4. The author makes transparent attempts to link totally disparate events so that they seem to have something in common and almost cause and effect. Example - the descriptions of injecting the prisoners with cancer cells and the Nazi experiments (Chapter 17) can only remotely, peripherally be construed as having ANYTHING to do with HeLa cells. It's comparing apples to oranges and these conversations have no place in this book.

5. The family seem to expect that they are owed something because they are recipients of a genetic lottery ticket by their (in many cases) tenuous associations with Henrietta's DNA. For example - her husband Day can arguably be described as the person responsible for Henrietta's cancer, as he was the person most likely to have infected her with syphilis and HPV - why should he or any of the other extended family financially benefit from the hard work of the geneticists and scientists that developed the successful cell cloning techniques?

6. The whole Lacks family are depicted as intellectual children and borderline retarded.

7. Why did the author use the convention to colloquialize the speech of the minority characters (the Lacks and Susan Hsu the Chinese lab assistant) but not any of the other foreign characters? Christoph Lengauer was born and raised in Austria. He studied human genetics/biology at the Unviersity of Salzburg, Austria. Dr. Lengauer received his PhD from the University of Heidelberg, Germany and went for his postdoctoral studies to the IMP (Institute of Molecular Pathology) in Vienna, Austria. He then joined the group of Prof. Bert Vogelstein at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. I cannot believe that Dr. Lengauer doesn't speak with an accent, yet the author elected NOT to colloquialize his speech or any of the other non-minority characters. This was probably the single most offensive thing about this book. It is condescending, sanctimonius, patronizing and probably racist.

8. Why is Zakariyya depicted as a sympathetic figure? He is a murderer, a drunk and a violent societal parasite. Compare this with the depiction of the fake lawyer (Cofield). I'm not fan of lawyers, but as far as we know, Cofield never killed anyone. Why is Cofield a terrible, albeit bumbling villain, yet Zakariyya is someone that deserves sympathy and pity?

These were some of the main points that came out in our discussion. Some of the students initially said that they enjoyed the book and they ""felt sorry for the family"", but once we actually began teasing apart the numerous problems with the novel, every student agreed that what we read was not the story of Henrietta Lacks or of HeLa cells, but instead the story of Rebecca Skloot and her naked ambition for fame.",,,"This book is so dated as to be useless to the casual reader. While the cases it presents may still be interesting for those in the profession to analyze, people reading from a less professional perspective will find nothing of any worth. This book is so full of horrifying 1970's style racism (comparing ""savages"" to children and ""retards"" and ""simpletons"", calling cases retardeds, simpletons, idiots, and worse, etc) that while some of the information may still be valid today, I cannot take a single word of it seriously. If the author took the time to read and write a forward for the audio edition, why on earth didn't he take the time to go through the text, and at least update some of the worst blunders? Yes, I realize time and language have changed. But that's no reason to perpetuate historical mistakes in what is sold as a popular psych book, especially not when the author is alive and well and could update the text.","Anyone who has read the released police files and journals of the shooters can see how off base this is. Cullen completely ignores any and all evidence that conflicts with his theory, and massively exaggerates anything that even slightly works with it.

The only way to truly understand Columbine is to read the released documents and form your own opinion based off of that raw, unbiased, factual information. People praising this book are every bit as bad as the people who ignorantly believe the media coverage, because the information here is just as skewed.","This book is bad. Well, not just slightly bad, but TERRIBLY bad. How anyone can believe this tripe is truly beyond all realms of imagination. Get Marlin Marynick's 'Charles Manson Now' and Schrecks new and updated 2011 book 'The Manson File: Myth and Reality of an Outlaw Shaman' from his website.

This book is terribly bad. So much nonsense it's almost embarrassing. I suggest getting 'Charles Manson Now' by Marlin Marynick (read the Star review on the Amazon page for it) and Nikolas Schrecks' new and updated 2011 900 page edition 'The Manson File' which I believe is only available via his website.

""Helter Skelter is the most famous (or infamous) work attributed to the Manson case. Bugliosi, in his work as a prosecutor for the case, compiled his thoughts and evidence in this somewhat dubious award winner.

Unfortunately, the book itself falls somewhat short of a literary masterpiece, and seems to have won most of its acclaim as a result of people's terror shortly following the case itself, and their willingness to ingest whatever was written, as soon as it was written, mirroring the media circus fiasco which the case itself spanwed.

Dwelling on the somewhat unbelievable and conspiracy-driven helter skelter theory, the book, and Bugliosi himself, posits an undeniably fantastic scenario, in which a Satanic hippie with unlimited supplies of drugs, managed to convince his various young apostles to proceed with plans to begin a race war through killing. Bugliosi of course points out that Manson was trying to kill a former Beach Boy named Terry Melcher who promised him a record deal, in an attempt to get back at a system which rejected his self proclaimed musical talent.

The gaping logical holes in the case force logical individuals to place Helter Skelter in the fantasy section at their library. As pointed out by the somewhat more enjoyable and well written work ""The Manson File, Myth and Reality of an Outlaw Shaman"" by Nikolas Schreck, Manson was aware Melcher was no longer at the murdered residence at the time, but had moved some distance away (he would have known this since several of his friends visited him often to use drugs together.) The idea of controlling people using LSD is ludicrous when one studies the actual effects of the substance, a fact the government itself understood after failed MK-ULTRA experiments attempting to use LSD as a mind control drug and truth serum.

The sad fact is that this entire work is nothing more than pulp fiction spawned by the anti-drug and anti-hippie bent establishment in the late 1960s and into the early 1970s. With an obsessive, almost religious fervor, Bugliosi repeatedly returns to his race war theories, without even visiting other possibilities in the case.

In fact, the entire work seems to have been written with the sole purpose of absorbing as much money as possible following the case, with a mind to sensationalize it as much as possible, so that the scope of interest would increase. It will likely appeal to people who have limited understanding of the case, and are just looking for a spooky late night insomniac's friend to help them sleep unsoundly with a heavy dose of psychopath-hippie nightmares. ""

This book is really one of the worst fictionalised accounts of what went on, ever! How it has become the number one book is beyond me! So outdated, so, so,... fake. I agree with the other reviewer, if you want an accurate look at the issues, the case and Manson himself, get 'Charles Manson Now' by Marlin Marynick AND definately The Manson File: Myth and Reality of an Outlaw Shaman by Nikolas Schreck. Currently, the latter book is only availabl from his website - that is the new, expanded, updated 2011 900 page edition.

The Manson File, as brought to you now by Camion Noir, is much more than a revised and expanded edition of Nikolas Schreck's ""The Manson File,"" which appeared in the late 80s. Former member of the gothic / industrial experimental combo RADIO WEREWOLF, Schreck has never ceased to try to establish the truth about the 'Manson Family', and the grotesque fraud of the trial of leading Spahn Ranch figures, conducted, it should be remembered, in the absence of Manson, whose choice to serve as his own legal representative was denied numerous times by the court ... The work accomplished by Schreck is titanic. The book's sheer number of pages might dissuade the potential reader. But no lesser length would suffice to present the complicated ins and outs of the case presented here in so logical and irrefutable a manner. And when you immerse yourself in the narration of facts, it becomes impossible to deny them. The Manson File is a spider web designed to trap any flies of lies that have gathered in the last forty years. ... Each character, each story has its own rationale, and even if we can get lost in this labyrinth of truths, and the characters' names get tangled, everything becomes clear in the end, and the puzzle is reconstructed. ... If the proponents of the hackneyed Helter Skelter theory have preferred from the outset to focus on a small group of culprits, the affair of the Tate/LaBianca killings is shown here to have involved a huge number of direct and indirect protagonists, many of whom were illustrious figures of the dying sixties scene. But the main responsibility for this hypocrisy that the American justice system has called a ""trial"" for four decades, is without a doubt Vincent Bugliosi, who masterfully played this parody knowing he was cast in the best role.... Throughout the book's long development, Nikolas Schreck strives to reveal every aspect of the many different stories concerning the character of Manson. Far from trying to make a martyr of him, and far from trying to present him as a saint sacrificed on the altar of dissimulation, he is content to present him just as he is, with all of his philosophies and his contradictions, as the criminal/ philosopher he has always been. The mere fact of presenting Manson's words verbatim is indicative of the author's desire for truth. As one who has communicated many times with the most famous prisoner in America , he knows who he's dealing with, and does not disguise his thoughts to give birth to an uproarious and highly praiseworthy work. After reading this book, we've encountered a Manson who is always funny, annoying, disturbing, contradictory, but above all fascinating. The man who could have been a beacon of freedom in thought and action ended up imprisoned for life because of meeting the wrong people at the wrong time. ... The Manson File is divided into several sections, distinct but complementary. It's evident that the author tried to understand all the different aspects of Manson's personality, the episodes of his life and his encounters, and to understand all the nonsense presented at his trial in the late 60s. Charlie is presented in turn as an influential musician of integrity, a shaman as defined by authentic Indian cultures, but also as a criminal who has spent more time in prison than in freedom, and never felt as safe - physically and intellectually - as in that cell. As I said previously, his trajectory is transcribed faithfully, without any attempt at ""romanticization"" if I may be excused this neologism, and when the language requires, Manson becomes the simple car thief or pimp he's always been. ... The image reflected in this book is a hundred leagues away from the buffoon embittered by the lack of recognition of his peers, and the cult leader eager for blood and vengeance against the establishment. Schreck puts center stage the real culprits of the case, the demented Charles ""Tex"" Watson, who has become a repentant ""good Christian"" supported tooth and nail by a procession of fans, star hairdresser and notorious drug dealer Jay Sebring and his friend / sidekick / nemesis ""Voytek"" Frykowski, friend to Roman Polanski, the husband of the late Sharon Tate, and especially updates the tenuous links between Hollywood, the Mafia, the American prison system, the Pentagon, the CIA, and U.S. Secret Service. What might seem from afar to be yet another conspiracy theory as seen from outside proves entirely credible in these pages and sends shivers down your spine. Thus, the comparison between the mock trial of the Cielo Drive murders and the catastrophic Warren Commission Report is logically proven as a concealment of facts that can on no account be revealed to the light of day. That The Manson File names Dennis Wilson, Sammy Davis Jr., Kenneth Anger, Mama Cass or Anton LaVey is not especially surprising. More so is the appearance of Steve McQueen, Frank Sinatra and his daughter Nancy, ""Lucky"" Luciano, Jean Harlow or JFK. And the strength of this book is that it manages to establish these connections between these different figures as distant by their rank as their spatiotemporal situation, without falling into the lowest kind of grotesque sensationalism. And once the big picture is put together, the evidence is shown all too clearly to the reader. ... Please note, I am not saying here that we must accept all of Nikolas Schreck's arguments and conclusions, and it will suit each reader to form his own opinion. But after forty years spent swallowing the ""politically correct"" versions offered up the former protagonists of the case, whether defendants, prosecutors, former cops and even simple figures of the establishment at the time, The Manson File's luxurious ""Apocalypse Edition"" comes like a breath of fresh air, and most importantly, a door to a truth ... This detailed study, which is never content with a simple surface survey, or a simple research work on materials already available, scrapes tirelessly into the deepest reaches of Hollywood's second Golden Age ... Read The Manson File ...

Manson was not present at the scene of any murder, he was two hundred miles away. Witnesses have stated such. There is no evidence placing him at the scene of crimes for which he was convicted. He was not allowed to testify at his own trial. He was not allowed to call any witnesses at his trial. He was not allowed to present any physical evidence at his trial. All of this is unconstitutional.
The man who actually did the killings, Charles Watson, was tried separately from Manson and the three women who were convicted. The prosecution did not allow Manson to be tried separately from the three women. The women were coerced by prosecution to testify against Manson. Grand jury statements were made that were preposterous. One woman, Susan Atkins, was clearly mentally ill or under the influence of drugs when she made her grand jury testimony. No evaluation of her competence was ever made. She later rescinded her testimony, but it was still used in the trial
Evidence was botched, lost, and possibly planted. A traffic ticket that Manson received placing him 200 miles away from the crimes at the time of the crimes was ""lost"".
There was no testimony from any expert witness to corroborate the prosecution's claim of ""mind control"". I find that entire claim to be ludicrous anyhow; people cannot be hypnotized to perform actions against their moral code, and people cannot be ""brainwashed"" to do so either.
Several of the victims of the crimes were involved in drugs, child pornography, and had gambling debts, which made them vulnerable to a ""mob hit"" or contractual killing. Tapes made by Roman Polanski, husband of a victim, which allegedly showed acts of child rape, were lost or suppressed. Polanski was later convicted of having anal sex with a 13 year old girl and fled the country. One theory is that the sex tapes were the motive for murder. Manson testified that he was asked by Polanski to procure young children for Polanski to use in his sex films.
Manson admitted that he had knowledge of the crimes after the fact, but he swears that he had no foreknowledge of the crimes. Those who are accessories after the fact commonly are sentenced to 18 years in California. Originally, Manson was offered EIGHTEEN months by the prosecution if he would testify to the person who ordered the contractual killings. Because he declined to testify against a possible organized crime contractual killer, he was given the death penalty.
Because Manson and his friends lived on a hippy commune and practiced unpopular things such as free love, there was bias against them in the jury pool and other areas of LEN. They were further targeted for their radical environmentalist activities such as burning an earth-mover (I do not agree with violent protest either, but 40 years in a supermax prison is extreme). Manson practiced shamanism in many forms, and condones the use of psychoactive botanicals and other substances for trance work. (For the record, I don't agree with this practice either, but still, no reason to incarcerate someone for 40 years).
Finally, President Nixon had spoken out about the crimes, declaring Manson guilty; it was on the front page of the newspaper. Nixon allegedly declared Manson guilty as a method of suppressing the hippy movement which was then protesting the Vietnam war. The jury saw the statement made by the president, which should have caused a mistrial.

If I am mistaken in this matter, then I am in good company. Jonny Depp, Henry Rollins, Elijah Blue Allman (Cher's son), Neil Young, Hank Williams III and many other prominent celebrities all feel that Manson was railroaded. Journalists worldwide have written exposes of the above findings. He is actually a political hero to the Palestinians. You don't believe everything the press has written about witchcraft, do you? Then why do you believe everything the media says about Manson? Investigate the case for yourself... read the trial transcripts... throw out the self-serving book written by the prosecution.",,,Except mostly proven untrue.,"I normally try not to give books one star, but when I saw today that Goodreads users voted this the Nonfiction Book of the Year I decided that I should broadcast my contrarian opinion. I only hope that my shy, introverted voice doesn't get lost amid the noise of those windbag extroverts who won't shut up with their rave reviews.

I finished the book several months ago and I can only recall the most glaring problems. Most notably, the book included this horrible passage: ""{Extroverts'} skin is literally 'thicker,' more impervious to stimuli, cooler to the touch."" This sentence literally ""made me vomit"" all over my paper-thin skin.

Second, Cain's most demonstrative example of a self-actualized introvert is Rosa Parks. While I do not intend to trivialize the accomplishments of Rosa Parks, I think we introverts hope that we don't have to find ourselves in a move-to-the-back-of-the-bus situation before we can effectively utilize our special skill sets. What is the lesson here- that while an extrovert may become a CEO of a corporation, an introvert is likely to be the person repeatedly victimized by that corporation until other extroverts take note of the introvert's quiet dignity and start a movement to oust that CEO? If I am lucky, that introvert could be me!

While this book might be of use to parents trying to figure out what is wrong with their weirdo kid, it actually made me a little bit ashamed of myself. Reading it was the like receiving a Certificate of Participation in the game of life. Sure, I might be more thoughtful than other people, but no one is going to listen.",,,"This book is probably responsible for a lot of the silliness around the passive voice in modern school systems today. In fact, many of the examples of the passive voice are not passive at all. These and other issues are offset by White's essay towards the back, and the sensible rules regarding possessive nouns."
"After reading this much-ballyhooed and well-reviewed title, I feel like a guy who ordered hot dogs at a world’s fair only to be served scrambled eggs. At the risk of imitating the kid in “The Emperor’s New Clothes,” I’m writing this review to fans of true crime and saying that the true crime here was committed by the author: I find Erik Larson guilty of literary bait-and-switch. He apparently wanted to write a history of the Chicago World’s Fair of 1893 but knew that work would attract a limited audience. So, he figured: “Toss in some H.H. Holmes—America’s Jack the Ripper--and call it true crime. After all, Holmes attended the fair and even rode the Ferris wheel.”

It truly pains me to see this book listed near the top of true crime book lists. It is a book about the architecture of the Chicago World’s Fair that includes a short story about H.H. Holmes.

As a result, the two stories distract from each other. I read to the end hoping Larson would provide some connection between them beyond Holmes’s visits to the fair and was aghast to read Larson’s pretentious kiss-off at the end that even includes a comparison of his methods here with those of Truman Capote’s in In Cold Blood. I was prompted to compare it, instead, with James McManus’s Positively Fifth Street, a book that defied genre by combining the author’s coverage of a notorious Las Vegas true crime trial with his personal involvement at the World Series of Poker. McManus employed humor and fine writing to effectively link those two events. And, I was hoping Larson might do the same. He did not even come close.

If you want a book about Holmes, find a copy of David Franke’s Torture Doctor. And send this book back where it belongs, to the art and architecture aisles of the public library.","Well,this is the most terrible book I have ever seen,it was too terrible to read.It’s so terrible that I just want to burn it as fast as I can,and it cost me 58RMB.That was 58RMB,it was to expensive for me to afford.At first.I thought it was a good book,and I spend all my money on this book.And I was pretty annoyed about this I don’t have any other money for my breakfast,lunch,and even dinner.I haven’t drink juice for the whole year.Reading this is a waste of time,no one want to see this book again.It was just rubbish,and smelly book.It tells my nothing.I even want to sell this to the writer,and ask to return my money and some extra.It cost me too much time,and too much money on it.I prefer to see a movie instead!!!","This is a book of ineptitude, arrogance and vanity on a colossal scale. Ineptitude because not only does Bryson misrepresent the facts when he tries to simplify them, he often gets the facts themselves wrong. Arrogance because he thinks he can write a better book than the genuine scientists who wrote his school textbooks, ignoring the fact that their brief wasn't to write chatty biographies with the science itself only mentioned in passing (readers of Bryson will probably remember Max Planck's tragic family life, but few will be any the wiser about Planck's Constant). Vanity because he thinks he can amble through the history of science and write something worthwhile about it in the same way he writes about the towns he passes through for his travelogues.

Why would you hire a travel writer to pen a science book? Because he's Bill Bryson and you could put his name on the phone book and it would sell shedloads. Otherwise this book has little to recommend it. Sure, he writes with his customary engaging joviality, but as he says himself in the introduction, there are plenty of proper scientists writing engaging and interesting books for the layman, so quite why he felt the need to write his own book to counter the dull texts of his 1960s schooldays escapes me.

This negative impression isn't helped by finding a huge, glaring error in just the second paragraph:
""Protons are so small that a little dib of ink like the dot on this ‘i’ can hold something in the region of 500,000,000,000 of them, rather more than the number of seconds contained in half a million years.""

That's more like five million days. It takes a minute with a calculator to work that one out, but neither Bryson nor his editor could be bothered.

And to quote from the Acknowledgements:
""Goodness knows how many other inky embarrassments may lurk in these pages yet, but it is thanks to Dr Tattersall and all of those whom I am about to mention that there aren't many hundreds more.""


Poor Dr Tattersal (and the others Bryson then mentions): publicly shamed as the supposed experts who managed to miss so many embarrassing errors. To be fair, as a professional editor I know you are judged not by the 99% of errors you catch but by the 1% you miss. Who knows how many mistakes Tattersal et al corrected to prevent this book from being even worse than it is?

At this point Bryson should have realised that he'd written a book whose only value would be to his own pension pot and his publisher's bottom line. I can understand him being reluctant to jettison three years of work, but considering he'd made a similar horlicks with Mother Tongue a few years earlier – on a subject where he might more reasonably claim to be qualified – one wonders why he started the book in the first place.

Sure, you can read it for the easy, witty writing, but it's distracting when you know you can't trust any of the facts. It's still the first chapter and we have: ""with Earth reduced to about the diameter of a pea … Pluto would be … about the size of a bacterium, so you wouldn't be able to see it anyway"". Even if it's a petit pois and I'm not wearing my glasses, I can still see Pluto on that scale.

If the errors are so obvious to me (and my degree is in Medieval History), what hope is there when it comes to the more technical science?

And spare a thought for real academics writing far better books than this. People will snap up Bryson's populist garbage, leaving their books to gather dust on the shelves. Wealthy, successful Bryson, for no better reason than vanity, has stolen the book sales of authors more deserving than him.",,,,,"I will say this: he makes some interesting points about geographical and geological determinism and the potential validity thereof. Everything else, however, is basically shit. The Pulitzer this book got must have been the world's biggest and most expensive A for effort.

Diamond writes in his introduction that a multi-discipline effort ""would be doomed from the outset, because the essence of the problem is to develop a unified synthesis. That consideration dictates single authorship, despite all the difficulties it poses."" He does go on to mention ""guidance from many colleagues,"" but even so this makes no goddamn sense (p. 26). It is actually possible to find people across disciplines who agree on a single theory - like, say, gravity. I'm using theory in the scientific sense here, where the fact of gravity's existence is obvious but there needs to be a framework of mechanical explanation - and this framework has the potential to be proven wrong. That doesn't change the fact of gravity's existence, it just means that one person's (or several people's) proposed explanation of its mechanics was misconceived. You can see similar approaches in the field of history. What this boils down to is, Diamond is saying right in the bloody introduction to the whole book that he was the only one who could do this glorious project and he didn't want to bring other people in because they might not agree with every single thing he's saying. GOD FORBID.

This book would have benefited from multiple authorship, particularly a partnership with someone who had some actual experience with historical research and thinking, because the incessant lazy errors are impressively offensive - Diamond keeps predicating his argument on such and such historical facts, but the facts he's using are flawed and wrong. Take his chapter on the Spanish invasion of the Americas. First off, he calls the indigenous naive like the extinct megafauna of the previous chapter - I'm not kidding, he uses that exact word and that exact comparison to animals; for somebody who's so avowedly anti-racist that's a fucking awful rhetorical tactic - but the academic offense is that his primary sources for the capture of Inca leader Atahuallapa are, as far as I can tell, Spanish letters to the king and Spanish personal journals. That's it. (Nothing is properly cited in this book, which is another cringe point.) Even a high school student could tell you that you should use and cite primary sources from multiple sides of an event, cite your secondary sources, and use some goddamn critical thinking. If you look at the Inca sources, sure there's some conflicting accounts - same goes for the Spanish - but what's obvious is that they weren't naive. Diamond asserts that Atahuallpa had bad information and it was an obvious trap supported by the advantages of Spanish literacy, but if you look at all the sources the situation is more that he had the right information but chose to be diplomatic in the Incan tradition. Pizarro was just a dick. (Diamond is right about the significance of germs, but that part's a gimme.)

There are a lot of fundamentally flawed arguments like that - e.g. pre-invasion indigenous people on the coast of Australia being described as totally isolated even though the historical record shows them as being brilliant sailors and the numerous islands between Australia and the Asian mainland are reachable by walking in places, or talking about the easy dispersal of animals/crops across a continental ""axis"" of north/south or east/west despite huge mountain ranges and climate differences across the terrain like in Asia - and his broader assertions are also seriously problematic. Like when he's discussing the supposed advantages of the written word (completely dismissive of pictographs and no mention of signed languages, of course) he name-checks Chinese and Japanese but otherwise devotes his syllabic-complexity argument to Roman-alphabet languages. Which, no. Focusing on the languages that are easiest for you to understand is far from persuasive. (To say nothing of the historical errors in that chapter as well.) And then there's smaller things like the series of photographs of people, all not white and mostly wearing indigenous clothing and unsmiling expressions, which is totally unnecessary - if Diamond's ""objection to such racist explanations [of sociocultural differences vis-a-vis a western capitalist definition of success] are is not just that they are loathsome, but also that they are wrong,"" then what the fuck are these pictures doing in here (p. 19)? Why does it matter what these oh so poor, less successful people look like? Jesus christ.

I could go on and discuss the further problem of his trying to fit history into a science framework, when the two have different approaches for a reason - which is, of course, not to say that the philosophies and conclusions of one can't support the other - but I think the point of Diamond's colossal hubris and scholarly failure has been sufficiently made for this review. (There are critical essays by people more professionally accomplished and generally articulate than myself out there.)

Is this the worst book ever? No. But it's still a fucking waste of space.

I felt cheated by this book. It started off with such promise and like a fat person with a box of chocolates in front of them, I couldn't wait to get wired in. At one point, I decided that this book was worthy of four stars. By the midway point though I was tired. Tired of the repetition. How many times does Jared Diamond have to refer to the fact that he believes the rise of food production to be the main determinant of success for a society, before he believes the reader might believe him. It just seemed like in this book, it was (at least) one time too many.

Diamond attempts to answer an age old question; what determines a society's position in relation to the others on Earth? The problem with the approach he uses is that it is just not robust enough to be worth sharing. My first problem is that just because things are the way they are, it doesn't mean they had to be. Unless otherwise convinced (and I would take some convincing) I just can't lend any weight to the idea that history is anything other than chaotic, influenced by countless factors, many of which we remain unaware. I just could not shirk off the impression that Diamond was coming up with a theory and then shoehorning facts into the theory to lend it credence. One example of this is the idea that societies rate of progress is determined largely by what way round the landmass they inhabit lies. He fails to mention The Alps, The Mediterranean, the Himalayas or the large temperature gradient between parts of Eastern Russia and Western Europe, as potential barriers to the diffusion of ideas between societies in Eurasia, instead choosing to blithely ignore them to fit his chosen hypothesis. To me that's a bit like saying that rather than teeth evolving to fit our diet, they evolved to improve our smile and hence give us more chance of attracting a mate. In other words, making up a theory to fit the facts and using the facts themselves as justification and choosing to ignore existing evidence.

To reinforce this impression in my mind, Diamond concludes by trying to justify his flimsy just-so explanations in a very patronising and unconvincing manner, suggesting that the main reason for disagreeing with them lies in a misunderstanding of the historical sciences and it's methods by the majority of people. He even goes as far as including the likes of evolutionary biology and astronomy in with history, suggesting that if we believe in the findings of the former disciplines, we should give more weight to the theories of the historical sciences (history). It is my belief that the findings within both astronomy and evolutionary biology are subjected to rigorous experimental testing, a belief which Diamond clearly does not hold. I could almost feel my faith and trust in Diamond as a scientist die inside me by the time I had turned the final page.

The whole thing is pretty flimsy. A few theories, which are either extroardinarily simple (geographical difference makes the difference in societies developments not the people) or flawed and/or lacking evidential support (the axis of the continent which a society inhabits makes a considerable impact upon it's development).

Finally the book is by and large, overwhelmingly dull. Diamond repeats himself like a broken record and wading through his prose feels at times like wading through thickened treacle on rubber stilts.

If you are looking for definitive answers to the central question of this book, answers that you feel assured are reasonably likely to be robust and accurate, this book does not provide them. It contains nuggets of trivia but that wasn't the reason I picked this off the bookshelf to read it and I think that would apply to most prospective readers.","“Outliers aren’t outliers…. they are [what they are] not because of some exceptional or heroic individual action on their part but because of whole series of circumstances, environments and cultural legacies.” – Malcolm Gladwell in an interview.

What is Gladwell essentially saying? He sums up the circumstantial, environmental and cultural reasons for being an outlier in the following ideas:

1. Luck has its role to play
2. Hard work and enough practice - 10000 hours – makes you good at almost anything
3. IQ doesn’t guarantee success. There exists a concept of IQ threshold. Psychological testing has its limitations
4. Being born at the right place, right time helps
5. Middle and higher class families typically provide better, nurturing home environments
6. Disadvantaged groups have access to fewer opportunities
7. If kids put more effort they could fetch better grades
8. Language affects how we organize information
9. Culture can shape personality
10. Racial discrimination has handicaps associated with it (epilogue)

Everything listed above (published in 2008) has either been out there in scientific and pop literature for decades, is scientifically tenuous (10000 hours) or is something that Captain Obvious would state. Gladwell has nothing new to offer, let alone adding an argument to enrich the nature-nurture debate. He ends up trying to convolute it with poorly supported assertions.

Part 1 broadly discusses about individuals, who indeed were exceptions. It was still pertinent to the title. In part 2, though, when he discusses the performance of Asians in mathematics or school kids taking California Assessment Battery – he is talking about averages and not outliers per se.
Different cultures prepare you for different things - cultural anthropologists established that in the 50s. Rather than comparing westerners and Asians on math performance, he should have addressed the existence of outliers within the oriental culture. That would have made more sense. He lost track in my opinion.

He makes sure that not one sentence is spared on confidence, motivation, temperament, personality dimensions, emotional regulation, self-esteem, self-efficacy, interests or learning/ perceptual styles! How did these factors play out in the lives of Gates, Joy or Jobs? Why are 80% of NBA players black? And why is not each one of them a LeBron, a Kobe or a Jordan?

He skipped judgment and decision making too. Decisions such as how and where to put effort into could be a critical success factor. I spent 220 minutes on this book. I could have used that time elsewhere. I could have slept or perhaps worked to accumulate those 10000hrs in one of my crafts.

Gladwell is not a psychologist; I should have known better. Drivel should have been expected.

The only outlier that doesn’t deserve to be one is this book itself. He should write a book on how “Outliers”, a below average text, managed to get a 4+ rating on Goodreads. I gave a star only because of the chapter on ice hockey and the 50 page babble dedicated to pilot communication – which, like so many in this book, was a feeble argument to make for a correlation between cultural legacy and outliers.",,I was so tired of this book that by the end of it I started to side with Hitler so the book would end.,"It was such a great story I was sure I was going to give it a 5. Then I entered the last 1/4 of the book and realized what a despicable person authored the book and gave it one star. I thoroughly enjoyed both the science, dilemmas, and human aspects of the story and I am very sorry it was not told by someone who was decent. Although feigning objectivity throughout it was obvious by the end that it was anything but. This author took advantage of this family for financial gain in a way much worse than any scientific research company. She spent an extensive amount of time convincing them they should trust her and she was on their side.
-This was largely an biography of Deborah; and unbeknownst to her. She should have been compensated as such. The author told Deborah that she could not compensate her and would have to set up a scholarship fund for her instead. Deborah believed her because she trusted her and it did not occur to her that Rebecca Skloot had no right to decide that this family could not decide how to spend their money themselves and also figure out how to compensate them.
-On page 267 she wrote her observations of Henrietta's sister Glady's upon having been invited into her private residence. Glady's was wheelchair bound and it was stated she was crippled by arthritis to the point that her chest was resting nearly on her knees. When the people came into the room this old woman trapped in a wheelchair is reported to have had her nightgown up around her waist and struggling to pull it down. Rebecca Skloot chose to forever strip her of the dignity she was desperately attempting to preserve by relating it in detail. Utterly despicable.
-The accounts of Deborah's erratic behavior became lengthy and actually tedious the last 1/4 of the book. (It is an example of her lack of objectivity and there are many.) It is obvious the author meant to portray her in this way at that time. Rebecca Skloot was hanging on until she got Deborah to give her Henrietta's medical records. At this part of the book Deborah had given them to her and had nothing more she desired and her relating of her 'object' changed.
-She accomplished nothing in pursuing these people in such an extreme way but her own profits. In the end the statement of one of the Lack's men was identical to what it had always been. They still did not know why they could not even afford health care if HELA had done so much to revolutionize healthcare and they wanted to educate their children in these matters so they would not be hurt like they were. (others pursuing them because Henrietta is HELA) There is no reason on Gods green earth why the Lacks cannot have those very reasonable things. Perhaps Ms. Skloot would like to see to it that happens starting with the profits from this book.
-I cannot stand what this author did to Deborah in the end. She related such deeply personal details about Deborah's state of health and mental health that support much of the hyperbole already surrounding this family that it is she they should sue.
-She violated the trust of Deborah in disclosing the personal medical records of her little sister. This was apparently an enormous struggle and the author relates extensive distressed conversation with Deborah extracting promises not to tell. She gave just as many extensive promises that she would not. Instead she related that young people institutionalized there were not separated by age or sex and that they endured sexual abuse. It is easy to figure out what Deborah was trying to protect her little sister and her dignity about. Ms. Skloot decided to violate that agreement as well as the trust of Deborah and trick her. Despicable.",,,"I just read half of it and I can't force myself to continue due to the simple fact, which is this book is very dull.
It felt like I was in a class and someone was just presenting interesting cases and stating psychological facts about each one. That's it.
For some reason I expected this book to be written from the patient point of you and not the doctor.","This is the first book I read about Columbine, and initially I thought it was excellent. However, after reading several other books on the same topic, I realised Dave Cullen's portrayal of Harris and Klebold was wildly inaccurate. The bullying aspect of Columbine High School is completely neglected in this book, as well, which is a major aspect of the reason for the massacre. Read ""Columbine: A True Crime Story"" by Jeff Kass and ""No Easy Answers"" by Brooks Brown and Rob Merritt instead.",Clearly written for prosperity and to capitalize on a horrible tragedy. If you take time to actually research the “Manson murders” you’ll see how very little truth is contained in these pages. Sensationalism at its finest.,,,"Rachel Carson is regarded as a pioneer of the environmentalist movement, which started, in large part, because of this book, Silent Spring. Here, she argues that DDT and other pesticides harm our crops, other animals, human life, and the natural world in general. I don't dislike this book for Carson's environmentalism, nor do I question her claims. I just found the book boring. Of course, this could be a matter of taste. I enjoyed the rich descriptions of the natural world at first but at some point it felt like eating so much chocolate cake. The only other way I could have enjoyed the book was if I was interested in the use of pesticides, which I'm not. I'm glad there are people in the world who monitor such things, but there are only so many causes a person can take up. You may, of course, feel differently if you read this book.","This was not not what I thought it was going to be - a scholarly, well-researched tome on the nature of introverts in society. Instead, I made it through about 85 pages of specious generalizations, poorly defined terms, and a suspect premise.

The fact that extroverts tend to dominate human societies is nothing new - certainly not sufficiently novel to justify this ""self-empowering"" guide to introverts who want (presumably) to reap the social benefits of extroversion.

That the author works as a life coach for dissatisfied introverts in the business and academic worlds should have been a dead giveaway, but I read this on the recommendation of a friend, and failed to exercise due diligence.

Frankly, I think most introverts (such as myself) will find this book unbearably condescending, and drop it like a hot rock.",,,"This book is packed with useless prescriptive fussiness. Ignore it.

Strunk's maxims are antiquated. They will cripple your writing. White's writing advice is almost useless. The kernel of his writing advice is to be concise and to write well. Great! But how do I do that? I imagine that if White wrote a safety guide for working in a steel mill it would contain just two sentences: ""Steel mills are dangerous. Don't die."""
"Finished. Done. Finally. This book was too easy to put down. I had such hopes. He writes in such a way that you feel completely absorbed in his narrative. It seems so interesting, until you realize, he just wrote about landscaping or concrete foundations for five pages and then I felt so betrayed that I'd put the book down. It was false advertising.

I wanted to read about how this psychopath wove himself into the 1893 World Fair in Chicago (dubbed the White City because all of the buildings built for the fair were painted white) but it never happened. Larson takes certain liberties and places H.H. Holmes (the devil in the title) at the fair with two women he murdered for a couple of days but it's the only time he ever connects the two stories.

He wrote an interesting history of the development of the fair and a descent portrayal of Holmes and his frightening existence, but how he decided to throw them together into one book and title it so that the two seem related is too much of a stretch. They both happened in Chicago in roughly the same time frame but it's like writing about the Washington D.C sniper murders like it had anything to do with building the World War II memorial on the National Mall. They just aren't related. Some happened in the same city during the same time...but some didn't and I don't think one really had anything to do with the other. Well, it's not quite as random as that...but almost.

I did learn a lot about architecture, and about the impact the fair had on America's history. That was fascinating. It brought about the design of the Ferris Wheel (although the first one was frightening - like 52 cars that could fit a hundred people in each one - no thanks), shredded wheat and other product icons. I probably would never check out a book on the 1893 Chicago World's Fair so if that was his intention...he succeeded. It's just too bad his talent for making even rose bed designs sound compelling couldn't produce the story he promised to tell.","Everything I hate about popular science - alternating between over-simplified, patronising, naive or simply annoying, but worst of all, blatantly refusing to take account of the political and social implications of its findings, and being proud of it.","This book was a total waste of time and I frankly cannot understand all the positive reviews.
The most important thing first: The book is full of errors. But not the-book-is-a-couple-of-years-old-and-we-didn't-know-better-errors. They are genuine totally-not-understandable-false-errors. Example:
""[the red giant star Betelgeuse is] fifty thousand light years away""
It's 640 ± 150 light years away.
Or this one:
""… 500,000,000,000 of them, rather more than the number of seconds contained in half a million years.""
500,000,000,000 seconds equals ~15854,9 Years.
And there are more and (in my opinion) worse errors in the book. Some of them are listed here. Bryson tries to wow his readers by throwing big numbers at them which are blatantly wrong. No science book should contain errors of this kind. It's ridiculous. And the errors are only one thing. Half of the book is not about science itself, but about the scientists. And it's all the time ""He did steal everything from his colleagues"" or ""He was mad"" and so on. Bryson seems so desperate to entertain the readers that he gossips too much which is really annoying.

You'll like it especially if you're a Beatles fan - which i kind of am - or if you're a hockey fan - which I'm not in danger of being. The premise of Outliers is that anyone who wants to acheive in arts or sports has to practice all the time, however gifted he is. Interesting premise which dragged out for too long. The author has no implementation sense and has no humor. Recently I found out that someone has acccepted the mantra that 10 000 hours of practicing his swing will make him a pro golfer. That practicing 10000 hours will make anyone earn his living doing what one likes most is evident in all the average soccer players that abound in England. I didn't need this book to tell me that.",,"Book 10 in Non Fiction November..
In the preface, the author wrote that 'Only those who experienced Auschwitz know what it was' this is a very important statement and tlcannot be any more true, it concludes the matter of the Holocaust is a simple sentence, thus matter that can be discussed freely as long as you are supporting and believing it, but when a single doubt or questioning of the tiniest detail of it is raised, it is met with a ruthless campaign against the person or entity that spoke it with inevitable destruction, and this is not a natural or acceptable thing from an objective point, in a world that is allowed to question and deny anything including flat earthers and those who promote that life is a reult of probabilities and chances, and that there is no god behind creation. So we can really accept the discussions for such matters despite all the evidence that refutes them  but we are not allowed to question a one sided tale told and forced upon the world by Jews?
It is a basic rule of studying history that one should read both accounts of the different sides for any event, as the truth lies somewhere between both sides of the story and that is the fact finding treasure hunt that one has to go through to find the truth, yet when it comes to the Holocaust, there is only one account, one universal truth that can't be argued with. From a historically objective point, this calls for a critical reading, since there is no other side of the story to balance it, and actually the blowback that comes from questioning it calls for questioning the authenticity of it.
For this book it doesn't add up, so how come the system that was intent on eradicating jews as pests, be very intent on evacuating them to retreat together against russian advances, when it was known that the war is coming to an end and Germany already lost. Shouldn't this system exterminate those still alive in the camps? What use is it for the nazis to go to all this effort to keep them alive? So that some of them could survive and live to tell the story of nazi concentration camps?","As a historian I read this book with rising horror and revulsion at the wholly unethical way Rebecca Skloot pursued the Lacks family after they had asked her not to call them anymore. At the point where you're quoting the Lacks children saying they felt they had no choice but to talk to Skloot because she wouldn't stop calling them, this woman became no better than a tabloid journalist. It seems as though she has created an ""us and them"" in her mind between her harassment of the Lacks family and that of other journalists who did the same thing. She mentions late in the book that while she was speaking with Henrietta's cousins in Virginia over the course of ten months since Deborah told her she was unwilling to speak to hee anymore, she was calling her ""every few days"". This is totally unethical and goes against everything historians are taught about approaching subjects for research, no matter the public interest in what they might have to say. I'm sorry I spent money on this book since she didn't give a cent to the Lacks family, and without their generosity and patience and willingness to share their traumatic family history, she wouldn't have had a story in the first place.",,,"Dr. Sacks is a neurologist who wants to be a philosopher. Unfortunately for us readers, he did not want to be a writer. This makes for frustrating reading and a violation of the cardinal rule of writing: know your audience. If you are also a neurologist who wants to be a philosopher and you have old fashioned ethics, then this is your book! If, like most people, you are not, then prepare for medical jargon coupled with esoteric allusions embedded in stories that ramble on and on until they abruptly end.

Dr. Sacks will examine how the human spirit is affected by the medical condition at hand, and this is fascinating at first. Amnesia and other rare psychological disorders have been milked fantastically by Hollywood, so simply telling the true version would make for a compelling read. Unfortunately, Dr. Sacks tries to get at the human spirit of the patient, and this leads to pulling in Kant, Hume (""Humean being"" was easily my favorite unintended pun in the book), Wittgenstein and others as a springboard for lengthy ramblings about the nature of humanity and what makes us human. These ramblings often trail off into a series of questions for the reader, not unlike a sophomore philosophy essay.

Worse yet, multiple stories lack an ending. For instance, we only hear about the one night of a man who suddenly believes that his left leg is not his own. Fascinating story, but we don't know if he snaps out of it the next day or saws it off later that night! The story just ends. Often times the ending is vague and consists of the person doing alright all things considered.

Multiple times Dr. Sacks will reference specific works of fiction or his own jargon (""incontinent nostalgia"" comes up many times before the chapter that defines it) and how this person is just like a character or situation in ""Funes the Memorious"" by Borges, or ""The Door in the Wall"" by HG Welles or the L-Dopa patients in Dr. Sack's other book. These stories are never summarized, so you will want an encyclopedia handy, otherwise you'll be missing out. The most frustrating instance of this is the entirety of chapter 9, which discusses two interpretations of a presidential speech without ever telling us anything about the speech!

However, there is one thing that kept me reading for as long as I did: the glimpse into the mind of old doctor ethics. This is a time when, ""Give it to me straight, Doc."" was necessary, as Dr. Sacks often does not tell the patient what is wrong. In the title story, when asked by the Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hat, ""What's wrong with me?"", Dr. Sacks dodges the question! We also get to see the archaic system of care for the mentally handicapped, as we meet a woman who has literally never done anything for herself because of her Parkinson's and a caretaker who flatly says, ""He's an idiot. Don't even ask him. [...] They say he's 'autistic', but he is just an idiot.""

Caveat lector!","Imagine living in a small town. Something rather incredible happens two towns over. There is no internet, and the local newspaper only has one reporter to send--the publisher's aunt who usually covers food or the local bridge tournament.

Reading this book was like listening to that reporter. Repetitive, not recursive: ""and then the propane tanks didn't explode,"" and 14 pages later, ""but the propane tanks didn't explode,"" and 11 pages later, ""but Eric was disappointed that the propane tanks didn't explode.""

The stories behind the Columbine shooting, like bridge, have some potential to be interesting. Reading this book, however, was like reading those disastrously written reviews. And then North played the Jack of Spades!

My favorite part of the book? ""What chance did he [the government teacher:] have against a clever young psychopath? Few teachers even know the meaning of the term."" Well, we might not know the precise definition of the term, but like the Supreme Court and pornography, we do know it when we see it. It usually sits in the first row, block 4.","Ugh...this book was so unnecessarily long. I was intrigued by the cult mentality and wanted to hear how people could become so enamored with a person that they would do anything for him; however, most of this book reads like ""I'm the best lawyer and I know more about lawyering than everybody. Clearly everybody is guilty—even of crimes for which they were never convicted."" It's also interesting that the author spends a large amount of time towards the end of the book discussing how wrong he thinks it is that others profited from the murders by publishing creative endeavors.

I quickly realized what I was in for when early in the book when the authors gave their background as Harvard Jews and profiled a guy that infiltrated the KKK for the ADL. The story sounds at least partially made up.

It then jumped into predictable white guilt inducing trash and goes into mental contortions using ""data"" and sociological explanations for black criminality and low IQ scores. The writers of this book are also obsessively pro-Abortion. The only surprise was they used statistics to show you are much more likely to die from an automobile or a swimming pool than a gun. This book would probably appeal to upper middle class liberals who like to consider themselves clever and politically astute from their isolated armchairs.

Elie Wiesel overdoes it. Wait, no, I am not saying he didn't suffer. Not that part. Elie Wiesel overdoes the writing. As more competent people than me have pointed out, this is a book which has been culled down from a 800+ page historical fiction to a barely 100+ testimonial along its' journey of various translations. I really think a lot of the nuance has been lost in the process. The page on this on Wikipedia has this bit

Seidman argues that the Yiddish version was for Jewish readers, who wanted to hear about revenge, but the anger was removed for the largely Christian readership of the French translation. In the Yiddish edition, for example, when Buchenwald was liberated: ""Early the next day Jewish boys ran off to Weimar to steal clothing and potatoes. And to rape German shiksas [un tsu fargvaldikn daytshe shikses]."" In the 1958 French and 1960 English editions, this became: ""On the following morning, some of the young men went to Weimar to get some potatoes and clothes—and to sleep with girls [coucher avec des filles]. But of revenge, not a sign.""


This is important because the entire tone has been flipped. Maybe this is a singular instance but this implies so much. I won't say whitewash but I really think the years on Wiesel has led to him making this a legend, this literary tale of what really was human people doing monstrous things in inhumane environments. People who follow me will know this quote from Iris Chang

""Civilisation is paper-thin.""

Wiesel in Night tries often too hard to elicit emotions. I feel very bad for saying this but he does. He writes these over the top dramatic sentences which just do not land. THEY DON'T LAND. This is my personal opinion, that instead he could have just let the moment linger and the horror set in. The dramatics only draws us away. My favourite parts of the book are when I hear other characters talk or do things. Too often we are just plopped down and made to hear what Wiesel thought about it and he doesn't really offer useful insight, he just tries to flap his wings for effect and all it does is lend what may be a true non-fictional account, the air of a fairy-tale because he smooths over characters, reduces them to situations and his perspective. In a way, he actively smothers the characters. Franek the foreman(who is kind normally but greedy and looking out for himself more than anything else) is a genuinely interesting character but all we get to know of him is through Eisel's eyes and his assumptions about him. He is reduced to his two incidents with the author. Maybe I ask too much, how can a man tell you about other real people whom he never got to know.

But look, Iris Chang in her book, offers a captivating duality of Matsui Iwane, the general of the Rape of Nanking. While she says that he is guilty and deserved death, she also doesn't fail to highlight that some onlookers say he was genuinely distressed by the massacre but just didn't act.

What ends up here is that Elie turns a horrific true story into a parading of his literary writing skills which aren't nearly as good as he thinks them to be. It reduces the narrative and I can't help but imagine how much better this would have been if he had adapted a more strict approach to either side. He could have written a formal account which would be more terrifying just for stating the facts as it happened and letting you figure out how men can act like that. Or he could have written a fictional account, with broader characterisation which would have brought true humanity and suffering to the table. In his attempt to ""glorify"" his suffering and stretch it pompously to losing faith in god(which look if done right would have been fucking amazing), he only destroys the horrific reality of the situation and lends fact to fiction instead of the other way.","This book represents, to me, much of what is wrong is pop non-fiction. The author was far too present throughout the entire book, and the book itself is a much more about her and her obsession with Henrietta Lacks than it is about anything else. White guilt and righteous indignation were two main themes pervading much of the writing. The narrative was all over the place, and at the end of the book, I couldn't tell why it had been written. To educate about inequalities of health care? (not really, the issue was never actually discussed in anything but a hyper-emotional way) To honor Henrietta Lacks? (not really--her person and character disappears after a few chapters) To explain what HeLa cells are for? (again, not really--it was discussed, but not with any sense of purpose, more just a rambling set of facts) To just review the history of the cells and Henrietta's family in a wandering journey highlighted by chapters that were unconnected to one another without a broad theme? Possibly.

This sentence really illustrates everything that is wrong with this book: ""Though the judge in the John Moore case said patients must be told if their tissues have commercial potential, there was no law enacted to enforce that ruling, so it remains only case law.""

What the HELL is she talking about? Case law IS law! For example, all law regarding the meaning of the fourth amendment (searches and seizures) is case law. Terry stops and frisks? Case law. Miranda warnings? Case law. Case law IS ENFORCEABLE LAW. That's why it's enforced. All the time. If this author managed to miss that fact, what else is wrong? I could spot places in the book where she was just wrong about law, or places where her statements amounted to inaccuracies. But I don't know anything about science--so I could not spot where she was wrong there. What the hell was going on in this book? Who edited it?

And, also, as a personal note to Skloot: The John Moore case is not just law, it's a really important seminal case. So important that they make all law students read the damn case in their first year of law school. It's enforceable. Legislators don't need to enact another law to enforce it.",,,"Many many years ago while a lowly medical student, I read The Island of the Colour-blind and Cycad Island and came away a little underwhelmed. A grand desire to avoid any form of medical writing since has kept me away from the rest of his catalogue but with his recent death I decided to pick up one of his more famous titles.

I struggled. I think part of the issue is the intervening 30 years since publication. He's firmly routed in a somewhat outmoded form of neurology and it shows (plus he seems to love Freud). Ideas and knowledge have moved on and it makes it hard to appreciate read with modern understanding. He's also clearly got some idols and almost every anecdote is linked to them in some way without him really explaining their significance (aside from a brief mention in the bibliography).

His thoughts and interpretations comprise an odd mix of neurology, psychiatry and quasi-mysticism with a little sociology, philosophy and bullshitting thrown into the mix. There's definitely some ego at play here. I generally didn't accept his interpretations or like the style as a result and agree that his flowery repetitive prose can get a little muddling at times.

I had no issue with the terminology though I'm not sure the lay public would necessarily find it that easy to pick up without a glossary or some Wikipedia work. I'm not entirely sure which audience he's writing for.

If you throw in some outdated and insulting terminology, some terribly written reconstructed dialogue and a disjointed structure, it just didn't work for me.

He was clearly an intelligent guy who deeply cared about his patients and put a huge amount of thought into the inner workings of the mind. He just isn't for me.","Cullen basically takes Columbine and repackages the facts to make it seem like a botched terrorist attack and not a school shooting. He does this in order to cater to post-9/11 fears. He skews the facts and even narrates the killers' minds. Careful reading can parse what is fact and what is postulation; unfortunately, the 10 million readers this book has had didn't all do that, and most that I've spoken to (including some of my students) accept this book as fact. Comprehending Columbine is much more respectful and intelligent, but less dramatic and thus less appealing to mainstream audiences.",Completely unnecessary amount of douche baggery by the DA who prosecuted the Manson Family.

The book itself  brings nothing to the table. Worse than that, by cherry picking data to support her generalizations, she does introverts a huge disservice. She actually manages to make introverts sound like weaklings which I feel insulted by. Her implication that introverts are superior, sensitive beings who absorb every negative slight to slowly destroy their psyche is just ridiculous. 

In Chapter 11, she gives ‘insights’ for parenting introverts - Don't tell your kid she's shy, be a role model by greeting strangers in a calm gentle way, don't pick over-aggressive kids as playmates, let your child know gently that tugging at your pant legs is not okay, instead let him know speaking up quietly is better to get attention. Three simple rules will help: Smile, stand up straight and make eye contact? - What the bloody hell? In the real world, all that is just obvious basics of good parenting! She actually says “make sure you're not imposing your own dreams on your kid” Well, no shit!
 
Chapter 8 is probably her least balanced chapter. She discusses how studious the Cupertino Asians are and is positively salivating about how great they are. Reading this chapter, one would think that all Asian kids are born studious introverts and sadly have to make radical adjustment when they face the terrible extroverted American life. Presumably, the only extroverted Asians she met were the ones that were sadly changing their core beings to fit into American society! There’s no discussion of the pressures faced by the kids to succeed at the expense of exploring other aspects of life.
 
I wish I had read the conclusion chapter first which basically sums up the book. From her bullet points on the insights she felt she had provided, I’d have been able to see she had nothing more than already well known ideas and I’d have skipped this one.

Pretty interesting how much he dislikes criminologists but then (if I remember correctly), only mentions the same one or two names over and over when giving examples of criminologists that had agendas/tricked the public. Also the fact that the entire book, and the issues, feels very simplified. Actually the author puts it best himself:
""The typical parenting expert, like experts in other fields, is prone to sound exceedingly sure of himself. An expert doesn’t so much argue the various sides of an issue, as plant his flag firmly on one side. That’s because an expert who’s argument reeks of restraint or nuance often doesn’t get much attention. An expert must be bold if he hopes to alchemise (?) his homespun theory into conventional wisdom.""
This is often how I perceived the book to be written, very simplified, without enough nuance or room for possible explanations - only one right answer. I didn't like how the book was written, how the topics where dealt with, and had a hard time taking anything seriously after all of the self-admiration and the repeated ""all experts have agendas (except for us)"" talk in every chapter.","DNF at 115 pages.

The case studies in itself are interesting, and that’s the only positive point I can make about this book. I found it incredibly hard to get through the book. I’m interested in the medical and psychological fields, however, that doesn’t mean I know all medical terms. The book was very clinically written, and the writer barely explained any of the medical terms, which meant I had to look for definitions myself and thus slowed down my reading a lot. He also sounds very mean and derogatory towards the patients in his casestudy by calling them words such as ‘’idiots’’, ‘’simpletons’’ and the ‘’r-word’’.

Example: ‘’i thought it curious and moving that martin, a *r-word*, should have this great passion for Bach. Bach seemed so intellectual - and Martin was a simpleton’’. There were countless examples like these in that one chapter, let alone the rest of the book. How someone with such a negative opinion could’ve been a doctor and was allowed (by the patients families) to write this negatively about his patients is beyond me.","I'm so angry that this book has a high rating and is considered the top Columbine book. It's filled with so many lies! I read chapter two while scoffing, incredulously. The author writes about Eric Harris ""Dates were not a problem. Eric was a brain, but an uncommon subcategory: cool brain. He smoked, he drank, he dated. He got invited to parties... And he got chicks. Lots and lots of chicks. On the ultimate high school scorecard, Eric outscored much of the football team. He was a little charmer"". What in the actual fuck? First off, what a gross way to write. What grown man refers to high school girls as chicks? Yuck. And the lies! Eric did not get with many girls, and he most likely died a virgin. He was rejected by most of the girls he approached. It's obvious that the author is trying to paint a picture of Eric that just isn't true. He wasn't cool by Columbine's standards. Eric was at the very bottom of the school's hierarchy. Even bullied by freshmen when he was a senior. The author says that Eric is a psychopath and that bullying wasn't a cause for the shootings.

From Eric's diary:

November 12, 1998
Everyone is always making fun of me because of how I look, how fucking weak I am and shit, well I will get you all back: ultimate fucking revenge here. you people could have shown more respect, treated me better, asked for knowledge or guidance more, treated me more like a senior and maybe I wouldn't have been as ready to tear your fucking heads off. Then again, I have always hated how I looked, I make fun of people who look like me, sometimes without even thinking sometimes just because I want to rip on myself. That's where a lot of my hate grows from. The fact that I have practically no self esteem, especially concerning girls and looks and such. therefore people make fun of me .. constantly..therefore I get no respect and therefore I get fucking PISSED.

November 17, 1998
Whatever I do, people make fun of me, and sometimes directly to my face. I'll get revenge soon enough.

And from his final entry on April 3, 1999
I hate you people for leaving me out of so many fun things. And no don't fucking say, ""well thats your fault"" because it isn't, you people had my phone #, and I asked and all, but no. no no dont let the weird looking Eric KID come along, ohh fucking nooo.

Do these sound like the inner feelings of a cool, charming kid? Or do they sound like the words from a kid who's desperate to fit in and be accepted?

There are various reports from the boys' peers regarding just how bad the bullying was including jocks throwing skittles and other various food at them in the cafeteria. During one incident, Eric and Dylan were surrounded by jocks who threw ketchup covered tampons at them. Another incident saw fecal matter being thrown at them. They were constantly called ""faggots"" and a female student, amongst her group of girlfriends asked the boys when they were getting married. Eric and Dylan had to walk with their heads down or risk being tossed against a locker and called a ""fag"". They say Eric had it worst of all because he was small in stature. He also had an indent in his sternum, so he never took his shirt of during gym class, giving the jocks even more reason to bully him. He was also extremely introverted and shy, and he dressed differently. You can imagine how all this stuff would make him an easy picking for the bullies. His coworkers at Blackjack say that Eric complained he was being bullied. They say that no one ever gave Eric a chance.

Bullying is the fucking worst. I hate how it's downplayed in this book. How dare the author skirt such a vitally important issue. These boys didn't grow up hurting animals and looking for every opportunity to hurt others. If they were accepted by their peers and weren't bullied, the Columbine massacre would not have happened.

The author's confirmation bias is obvious, and he used small pieces of evidence and sometimes outright lies to support it. There are plenty of other lies and things that annoy me about this book, but I would have to write my own book to explain them.","Bored, that's what I was, bored!

Bugliosi is over dramatic and hammy, which makes the writing tiresome.",,,"To actually put into words what I thought about this book would take a very long time and possibly more characters than I am allotted by goodreads. Suffice it to say that Rachel Carson wrote an essay, not a book. As a book, it is incessantly repetitive and generally dull, but as an essay it is well-sourced and addresses many of the issues the author saw with insecticide use. There are many, many, MANY times that the author grasps at a ""perfect world"" kind of ideal, without accounting for the need for jobs and a level of specific yield for farmers to profit in the first place. Carson demonizes anyone who doesn't agree with her, and bestows sainthood upon anyone that does agree with her, even if it is the same group! This book is absolutely littered with logical fallacy and I couldn't wait until it finally ended. The absolute last chapter of the book is where the vast majority of her solutions to these problems can be found, but many of those solutions have just as many issues when taken and put into a biome as insecticide chemicals do. All in all, I'm glad that we saved Bald Eagles, Peregrine Falcons, and California Condors because of the scare tactics that were used in this book, but I do not agree with the blatant skewing of reality that Carson tries to pass off as fact, and the worldwide ban of DDT causing rampant death in countries (esp. in Africa) that need vector control. Individual human life is worth more than our genetics (something Carson specifically doesn't agree with) and individual human life is worth more than ecology. Yes, it is important for us to innovate products that are better for the environment if we can, but this is generally a gradual process. It is also important that production is not stifled by using new products, and that new products don't bring more harm then good, as Carson should have wanted. In the modern version of ecology, we are encouraged to ""go green"" but in so doing we encourage the cobalt mining that results in the deaths of so many African children that it is abhorrent that this is still a thing. Human life (and it seems necessary to distinguish this, AFRICAN LIFE) is more important than the lives of animals! It's ridiculous! If they are African, who cares if they die, if we get to see more birds in our country... AKA the new form of liberal racism.","I have finally finished this unbearable book of platitudes. ""Figure out what you are meant to contribute to the world and make sure you contribute it,"" she writes. ""Love is essential; gregariousness is optional."" And a good thing, too. ""Spend your free time the way you like, not the way you think you're supposed to."" If lines like this make you, like me, want to vomit, then you may want to reconsider spending your free time finishing this book like you think you're supposed to.

This book had little interesting to say about introversion that could not be captured in a 60-second Google search. It seemed to me that the book's primary purpose was, in fact, to flatter introverts -- the book's likely audience -- by telling them that they are not alone and that they, too, could contribute Value to the world. One of the author's favorite gambits, for example, is to reveal that some of history's greatest and most successful personages -- Mahatma Gandhi! Rosa Parks! Warren Buffett! Eleanor Roosevelt! -- were introverts (ZOMG! We introverts are awesome, hooray, lulz!). ""None of this is to denigrate those who forget ahead quickly, or to blindly glorify the reflective and careful,"" the author hastens to explain. Except that it is, wink wink.

She spends most of the book telling introverts what we already know about ourselves: that we are the way we are. (See, e.g., anectodal examples of introverts acting introverted, ad nauseum! And it's OKAY! Introversion is perfectly normal, guys! We're just mizunderst00d by those unfeeling, unthinking extroverts.)

To be sure, the author offers some potentially useful advice for parents of introverts, and for teachers and managers (Be mindful that there are introverts in the world. Don't just structure the world around extroverts! 'kay, thanks!). But the main thrust of the book is Hooray Introverts!, Introverts Are Cool!, If You're An Introvert and Want to Hear All About How You Are Just As Awesome As Everyone Else Please Buy My Book!

I’ve owned two copies of this book since the mid-eighties. It was on the list of required books for a couple of courses I took in college, yet I never even thumbed through either copy. So, since I’m one who always seeks to get her money’s worth, I felt it was high time to cash in.

WHAT DID YOU LIKE ABOUT THIS BOOK?

I appreciated this book’s commitment to no frills.

WHAT DID YOU NOT LIKE ABOUT THIS BOOK?

It’s dated; thus, gender-inclusive language is not employed, and there were a couple of cases of prescriptive snobbery that almost convinced me to stop reading the book. I'm committed to the rules of language in that it serves to facilitate communication, but it serves us best when it is reasonably dynamic.

I certainly was astonished when I read the following argument for the preservation of the male pronoun as the standard representation of all people.
No one need fear to use he if common sense supports it. The furor recently raised about he would be more impressive if there were a handy substitute for the word. Unfortunately, there isn’t—or, at least, no one has come up with one yet. If you think she is a handy substitute for he, try it and see what happens.

We’ve done just fine including the female gender as standard language since 1979, which was when this version of The Elements of Style was published. Furthermore, we are now in the midst of including transgender language. I’m fully in support of introducing a new set of pronouns to distinguish between cis-gender and transgender individuals. I’m not thrilled about using ""they"" in the singular though and hope ""ver"" and ""xem"" will be incorporated. My argument is why corrupt standard usage when you can expand the language instead? After all, it’s very exciting to create a new set of pronouns, especially since it doesn’t happen very often at all.

Each chapter begins with unnecessary aggrandisement of the author for the statistician, that jars the flow of the book.

Overall, a good demonstration of why ""social sciences"" are in no way close to being ""science"", and instead should be termed social philosophy.","DNF at about 40% because I couldn't stand it anymore.

Title is misleading. I wanted to read ""The Short History of Nearly Everything"", not ""Random White Men and Some of The Things They Did."" Seriously. Bryson is so fixated on the stories of these individual scientists and how they found out the age of the Earth and then proceeded to go bankrupt and get divorced or whatever.

I. Don't. Care.",,,,,I picked up this book based on the rave reviews of others. It is one of the very few books I put down before finishing. I found the author had the habit of making suppositions and a few pages later quoting them as facts.,"Crap. It was crap to me because the author made absolutely no sense to me. No offense to the author, but I'm a 16 year old girl who reads about Shadowhunters and make teenage demons on a daily--my brain isn't that complex yet. I also hate being told what to read, so I automatically hate the book I have to read. Like I hated this. Sorry, not sorry.",,"A slim paperback of barely more than a hundred pages, Night is the most grave and heaviest story of sheer depression, hopelessness, absence of God, hell on earth. So much weight it drags your heart down towards the point of denying that there was, more than half a century ago, such a story.","I had serious issues with the way the information in this book was presented. In many ways it felt sensationalized and like poverty porn. There are respectful ways to talk about people's struggles. This author didn't use them.
I have similar problems with this and The Help. Somehow it ends up being all about how the white woman feels. Dissappointing - there was at least one, and probably several good books worth of information to explore.",,,The way that this man talks about autistic people and people with intellectual disabilities is honestly so vile,"Dave Cullen weaves a well-researched and thoughtfully organized story together, covering the shooting, the planning, and the legal and emotional aftermath. Unfortunately, he does this at the expense of the truth.

Halfway through the book, I was planning on giving it 4/5 maybe 5/5. At this time, however, I started a cursory search online for other information about Columbine. On Reddit, r/columbine almost universally and vocally spews their distrust of Cullen's narrative. On Amazon, the mother of Brooks Brown (former friend of the killers) gives this book a 1/5 and details how inaccurate it is.

Most of the other criticisms of this book regard Cullen's attempt to craft his own narrative of the events, portraying Eric as a student motivated by psychopathy and hate and Dylan as a depressed and romantic teen who was dragged into the shooting by Eric. Cullen goes against all the evidence to assert that bullying/feeling like an outlier had nothing to do with the shooting.

Quickly after continuing the second half of the book, I discovered these criticisms to be spot on. Essentially, Cullen decided - for some reason that remains to be seen - to craft a contrarian narrative that disagreed with parents, students, witnesses, and - especially - Dylan and Eric. They write for weeks on end that they are motivated by revenge and film numerous videos where they list specific students by name.

Cullen is so clearly and bafflingly biased. There's even a sentence where he claims that ""love is the most common word in Dylan's journal entries. Eric spewed hate in his.""

Cullen's account of the events conflicts with the numerous other books published on this subject. I like a story just as much as the next guy, I just wish it was the right one.","This book is a massive act of perjury bent by the author to advance his career. Should be classified as fiction not nonfiction. Fun read if you like a fictional tale of ‘race wars by hippies’. Listen to ‘Chaos. Charles Manson the CIA, and the secret history of the sixties’ if you want to hear the true story about the Manson murders. Unbelievable this narrative has been pushed for so long.",,,"I will start by saying that some good came out of this book: thanks to her and people like Al Gore, the EPA was created, the FDA inspects more produce and requires more science before allowing pesticides into the market, and the USDA is also more involved. That said, it's hard to even classify this book as science. It's every anti science, anti corporate, anti modern breakthrough, and woo peddler's bible.
She starts off by trying to claim that the only disease carrying insects that exist are in areas of cramped living areas in cities, where cleanliness, sanitation, and poverty exist. Even in the early 1900s through the mid 1950s, this wasn't true. Certainly, there were more pathogen carrying insects, but such conditions do not need to exist for them to be a threat.
Then she actually tried to claim that farmers never had insect problems until they began single crop and farming for more than just a few families. Maybe she should have stuck to marine biology. Farming and anthropological studies have shown that insects have ALWAYS been a problem.
She continued to compare the use of pesticides to radiation fallout as a scare tactic. She cited multiple discredited researchers--many of whom were even discredited at the time of publication.
I especially took issue with the three examples of leukemia and DDT (not that there aren't problems with the insecticide itself), but leukemia doesn't develop and kill within hours or days. Ever.
According to her, the entire population will either be sterile, or develop some form of cancer. Just the fact that she alluded to the use of pesticides and ""retardation"" in addition to ""being mongoloid"" is infuriating. The idea came from Dr. H. J. Muller's work with Xrays and fruit flies. She went on to explain that people born with XXY, XXX, or XO chromosomes are also the result of pesticide exposure. (Or radiation.) Just about any illness and/or defect can be blamed on it.
My favorite line of the whole book? ""There is no 'safe' dose of a carcinogen."" Alcohol is a carcinogen. The sun is a carcinogen. Thousands of things we come into contact with daily are carcinogens.
It's easy to be afraid of chemicals, but just as easy to learn basic science.","From the start I was very frustrated with the ""us"" (introverts) versus ""them"" (extroverts) tone that carries throughout the book. This is a complex characterization; different people fit into different categories based on circumstances and situations. Putting everyone into only two categories oversimplifies human behavior.

The author states American society is dominated by extroverts; introverts are either pushed to the sidelines or forced to become extroverts. Yet the only examples she presents to support this statement are Harvard Business School and, to a lesser extent, salesmen. Neither of these examples are even somewhat representative of American society. Most of the author's examples of introverts seemed to argue against an extrovert dominated society.

The author only mentions the fields of law and psychology. Why wasn't there more research or discussion about stereotypical introvert fields like engineering, mathematics, or research science? I have a hard time understanding how the author struggled to make a connection between race but didn't dive into the segregation of professional fields in our own culture.

The Asian argument was interesting but poorly developed. How do Indian cultures differ? I would have been interested in more development of Asian business culture. Where is the line between cultural differences and personality type differences? (I used to work for an engineering firm in Taiwan; of all the challenges we faced, I never felt is was due to different personality types).

Another frustrating theme that carried throughout was one third to one half of society are introverts. Yet, the author narrated as if introverts are a significant minority, a uncommon occurrence. Where are all these extroverts that dominate our culture? I don't know any, maybe I have subconsciously built up a shield and only surround myself with the introvert minority.

One star may seem harsh, but this was a very frustrating book for me to get through.",,,"Don't read it! Everything this book says about grammar - which is a large portion of what its about - is wrong. Strunk and White believed objectively untrue myths that make anyone who has actually studied grammar cringe (some of these were added in later editions, others are baked into the original): ""you can't end a sentence with a preposition,""and ""don't split infinitives."" Strunk doesn't understand pronoun case (He vs Him, I vs me, ect.) and his section on why you should never use passive voice just shows that he doesn't even know what passive voice is. If you're looking at this book because some college professor or writer recommended, rest easy knowing that many of the people who swear by this book probably haven't read it.
As to the parts that aren't grammar, it's mostly things that sound like sage advice until you think about for a second and realize it's useless, like ""do not overwrite"" or ""be clear."" There is also a bizarre section that tells the reader not to use adjectives or adverbs. Obviously, the authors fail completely to follow their own advice."
"I guessed when I read the introduction of this book that I might not like certain aspects of this telling. Oh how right I was!

This book is a quick read--granted, I'm not finished yet (only about 1/4) (later note: finished it), but I didn't spend much time reading it either. The writing is smooth and it held my interest. It is really readable. It did try too hard at times, for example with the constant foreshadowing, and the veracity/objectivity quotient could have been more, well, present. But the problem is not with the writing, per se.

I suppose it comes down to my objections about sensationalizing violence against women. Larson is constantly uses foreshadow to try and pique your interest. I found it unsettling that Larson kept trying to titillate me about grisly murders of young women. Larson goes out of his way to tell you how beautiful and voluptuous and they all are, how ""rapturous"" their bodies. I'm assuming he means rapturous for the straight, Western, current mainstream male gaze, because we really don't know anything about these women and how they relate to their own bodies. And they're so ""young,"" too--a word that can be applied as reasonably to a person of 5 years old as of 35. And really, what does it matter their age or what they looked like? How does it even make a difference? What is he trying to say? That their beauty, large bosoms, or age were the ""cause"" or ""reason"" for their deaths? After all, Larson starts this book out with an epigraph from the murderer attesting that he was born to kill, he just couldn't help it--even though his deliberations, planning, and actions in daily life point to the contrary. Or is Larson's meaning less victim-blaming and more of a slasher flick gore porn tactic: ""See this nubile and attractive woman...now see her being tortured, hacked to pieces, and incinerated!!""? Is it that Larson only expects you to care about a victim that is conventionally attractive? Either way, I don't appreciate it.

I absolutely understand that these murders happened and that they are horrific. That's why I find it distasteful to put so much focus on Holmes and what he did and what he thought and how people interacted with him and what his childhood was like; and conversely, when the focus on the victims, to talk only about their appearance. Each of those victims had childhoods and plans and people they interacted with too. I can tolerate reading about a large amount of physical violence without finding it distasteful; many books that I find profound, moving, and important have very violent parts. Sometimes the violence is part of what makes a book important, as in books about wars and genocide. But in what I read of the book, the victims are portrayed as completely one dimensional, characterized solely as young and beautiful: that is also a violent act, albeit more subtle.

There were other instances of the same sort of weird, subtle hostility towards women. For instance, this statement, thrown in when relating a dinner party meeting for the fair's architects: ""There was not a woman in sight."" In context this is a complete non sequitur. It is a meeting of architects designing the fair; this is the 1890s: there are no women architects. Why would a woman be there? Indeed the only time Larson mentioned women in this story line prior to this was once to say Burnham and Root got married, and second to say ""By 1886, he and Margaret were the parents of five children."" It's not like Burnham's story line is teeming with females. Why draw attention to it now? Just to point out the fact that women do not participate in anything important, to remind us that they only exist to be slaughtered? Is that why? Is there some other reason? I am honestly curious and it is driving me crazy wondering what compelled him to insert that sentence in that place. [Update: I am happy to report that I was wrong about there being no female architects: there was ONE, who arrived on the scene much later, but I am unhappy to report that she was not given much importance in the book, and her little piece ends by being carted off to an insane asylum...so...]

There is a part in the book where Larson talks about all the disappearances in Chicago. He says, ""The women were presumed to have been ravished."" Ravished, yes--that's a nice euphemism for ""raped & murdered,"" isn't it? Ravish, a word my dictionary defines with ""(often be ravished) fill (someone) with intense delight; enrapture."" That the word refers to both rape and delight is not a mistake. And that Larson used this word is not a mistake either. And that is why I put down the book and wrote this review.

After having written this and let it sit for a few hours, I think one of the reasons I'm so fed up is that it's the second book nonfiction book I've read in two days that trivializes rape and violence against women. Yesterday's was memoir-ish, but this one...should have been more objective. He did so much ~research~ and blah blah blah. Many reviewers make the point that the stories of the two main men are not connected at all. So why choose Holmes? Why not, as one reviewer suggested, choose to tell the story a brothel madam's life, or a Zulu person who was at the fair? Or one of the new young working women, or one of the guys working at the Union Stock Yard, or a grip-car operator? You could easily tell the story of Gilded Age Chicago through them. But that, of course, would not be nearly so ~!~OMG~!~ riveting or sensational. So he makes the choice to use women's brutalized bodies to make his book a bestseller.

So those are some thoughts I have had part way through. I'm going to keep reading but I predict that I'm going to leave this book at 1 star because trivializing violence against women really bothers me. The rest of the book is actually quite enjoyable but this is a dealbreaker for me when it comes to rating a book.",I found this audiobook unbearable. I turned it off halfway through and listened to the public radio pledge drive instead.,"Bryson has a wonderful sense of humor, but Short History was too watered down for my taste. There were also many errors and over-generalizations.",,,,,"Diamond sets out to explain how and why is it that certain societies developed; why some never moved past being ""hunter-gathers,"" whilst others developed into Empires with complex organisational structures, a mercantile class ect ect. Diamond believes that the answer is not that there is an innate difference in the intelligence of individuals but rather is due to differences in the availability of desirable 'Real Estate.' That is differences in ""the continents’ different areas, axes, and suites of wild plant and animal species.""

Unfortunately this is book is an example of a novel completely loosing me in the final stages of my reading experience. Without the 2017 Afterword entitled 'Rich and Poor Countries in Light of Guns, Germs and Steel,' I would have still believed that Guns, Germs and Steel ultimately presented a flawed answer to the question posed by Diamond, as any attempt by an author who was attempting to distill 13 000 years of human development into a 400 page book would be.

Whilst Diamond maintains throughout his endeavour he has set out to dispel racist stereotypes that have persisted (and propagated by colonial powers), his single minded determination to see the development of human civilisation through the lens of a single historical theory, geographical determinism, combined with Diamond's insistence that Eurasian nations ""just got lucky"" ends up absolving colonial powers for their direct involvement in shaping the trajectory of modern African, South American and the Middle Eastern nations and Indigenous societies around the world. For example, in the 2017 Afterword Diamond insists that all South Korea needed to advance into a modern and wealthy nation and build on its historical ""advantages"" was "" only independence , military security and American foreign-aid assistance."" His statement betrays a key blind spot in his analysis. The word 'imperialism' never even appears in the book. In ignoring economics, religion, culture and the complex way class and political division was utilised by Empires throughout history to exploit societies and use the profits to aid their own development, Diamond's history ignores a large part of the story of human development.",Such a disappointment. Gladwell doesn't tell you anything you couldn't figure out with five minutes and a bit of common sense. His patronizing tone makes the whole thing just that much worse. Maybe he thought he was writing to four year-olds- they're the only ones who might actually fall for his crap.,,I read this for english so i didn't really have a choice,"I'm not sure why I didn't like it. The fact that one person's cells can grow in the lab and that another person's cells will not is interesting to me. But legally that is a non- issue - the Lacks descendants cannot legally benefit. I find it very sad that her children were not properly informed about everything. I do feel badly that they were mistreated as children, that they are poor and uneducated. However, I don't feel that the cells had anything to do with it. Would some kind of compensation have helped them? Am I a horrible person for saying that I doubt it? Their father, Day, is the true villain in this piece if you ask me. He slept around on his wife, gave her HPV which ended up killing her, and then he brought a horribly abusive woman into his home to raise his children. Would there have been any money for those kids with this type of father? I doubt it.",,,"I couldn't get on with the writing style at all. The title suggests there will be a little light-heartedness or, dare I say it, humour, but it's incredibly dry. There's also relatively little time spent on the patient cases and a whole lot of waffle and history of neuroscience, which isn't what I signed up for.","April 20, 1999. Two students who were part of the TCM [The ‘Trench Coat Mafia’] - Eric “REB” Harris and Dylan “VoDKa” Klebold - have walked into Columbine High School in Littleton, CO. They had intentions to kill. They brought a TEC-DC9, a 995 Carbine, and more, along with explosives. They killed 13 students, the youngest being just 14 years old. The two injured over 20 other students before committing suicide in the school’s library. They started their rampage outside, before heading into the school, placing duffle bags full of explosives in the cafeteria, set to detonate before they started shooting. The two devastated the nation, bringing fear and panic into lives of many. They caused higher restrictions for schools, in short, they caused chaos in schools. Their actions have and will continue to impact the nation.
I do not recommend reading this book. I respect Dave for researching this horrible, heartbreaking massacre, it can hurt to understand what truly happened behind those school doors. Sadly, it shows that Dave did put false information in the book. Eric didn’t get a lot of girls asking him out. Eric was lonely, barely having anyone. Yes, he did have people saying hello, but nobody except for Dylan was always there, hence why they did it together. Dylan and Eric didn’t have anyone, they were exactly as we would expect - two lonely, demented students. Once again, I do truly respect Dave for getting into the mindset to be able to stand researching Dylan and Eric for so long, but he should have left out any false information.","Tom O'Neil's Chaos reveals that Bugliosi's version of events of the Manson Family murders is seriously dubious if not outright fabrications. Manson and the Family did commit the murders but the Helter Skelter philosophy laid out in the book as the reason why is seriously flawed based on O'Neil's research. So why would Bugliosi need to have such an outlandish theory become canonical? I don't have the definitive answer but reading the pompous, self-satisfactory prose proves at least Bugliosi was using the case and the book to give him notoriety. He wants this to be the final say and give Vincent Bugliosi all the credit for jailing Charles Manson, while casually skipping over Manson's sketchy parole situation or his real relationship to Terry Melcher. It's a completely self-serving enterprise with some of the smuggest writing I've read in a while.",,,"This book has been responsible for more lies and death than any other book in human history, with the exception of 'The Communist Manifesto' and 'Mein Kampf'. Rachel Carson's crusade against synthetic chemicals, on the grounds that they caused cancer at a much higher rate than naturally-occurring chemicals (an unproven claim), led to the banning of the use of DDT against malaria-carrying mosquitoes in Africa. At the time, African countries were in the process of eliminating malaria from the continent. The consequence? Malaria was never eliminated. In fact, it returned with a vengeance and in the intervening decades tens of millions of Africans have died because of this ban on DDT.

Carson's 'scientific' claims have proven to be almost entirely false and/or gross exaggerations of the evidence. She claimed authority as a scientist, but wrote as an ideologue. This abject failure of this books major claims, combined with the millions of deaths due to her irresponsible rhetoric, is an object lesson on how scientists, when they push ideological agendas, ruin lives.","I found this book to be incredibly biased and dull, and I'm surprised that it is so highly rated with such great reviews. For someone who has studied and is well versed in the widely accepted Jung theories of introversion and extroversion, I found the author's take on introverted and extroverted qualities to be incredibly generalized.

The author made statement such as ""extroverts, in other words, are characterized by their tendency to seek rewards, from top dog status to sexual highs to cold cash"" and ""this theory of extroversion is still young, and it is not absolute... it suggests that when it comes time to make group decisions, extroverts would do well to listen to introverts, especially when they see problems ahead.""

I personally have known impulsive, pleasure-seeking introverts and thoughtful, problem-solving extroverts. These bold and generalized statements do nothing to help people understand each other's preferences or work more effectively together, rather they imply that one type is better than the other and encourage an ""us versus them"" mentality.

The author went back and forth between detailed dull scientific concepts, practical situational examples, and then over-generalized statements summarizing the two. The book definitely felt a bit self-serving, as the author makes it clear that she considers herself an introvert who has struggled in an ""extroverted world"".

I'm not saying that the author didn't make any good points or that there wasn't any truth to some of the concepts she put forward, but to be honest, the continued bias throughout the book made the author lose some credibility with me. There are so many great books out there about personality and introversion/extroversion that are balanced and put forth tips and suggestions for interacting with people who are different from us, that it's disappointing to see this book getting so much attention.",,,"It's not exactly a guide to grammar, and not really a guide to style. It's not terribly useful either.

The grammar section focuses on a few complex constructions described using jargon that is not really explained. Some elements of grammar presented as rules are in fact merely opinions of the authors and disagree with historical literary usage (as pointed out by GK Pullam in his wonderful article, '50 Years of Stupid Grammar Advice'). This includes the singularly offensive ""rule"" that unless the subject is explicitly female, the third person singular must always be masculine (for example, 'when a scientist goes to work, he usually ...'). There is some vague advice about composition, and finally there is a list of commonly misused words. I can't see how this book could be useful to anyone."
